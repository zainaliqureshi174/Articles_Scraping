# Articles_Scraping
I grabbed this Project on September 6 2024 from Upwork. This project basically demands Web Scraping through 120 Links.
These Links are the urls of Articles in which there is Text as well as Images related to the Article.
My client wanted to shift these Articles on a new website by using Wordpress.
When I Scrapped the Text, It was in the following Formate:
"Hi this is Muhammad Zain Ali.\n I am Pursing a BS AI Degree from FAST NUCES Islamabad, Pakistan.\n I am also a Freelancer on Upwork.\n"
But my client wanted to add <p></p> tags in this Text. So I converted the Text into following Formate:
"<p>Hi this is Muhammad Zain Ali.<p></p>I am Pursing a BS AI Degree from FAST NUCES Islamabad, Pakistan.<p></p>I am also a Freelancer on Upwork.</p>"
My client also demanded that he needs all the img urls in the form of:
<img src = "https://Exampleurl.jpg">
So after scraping all the text and image I simply converted them into the desired Fromates.
This was a hardly 1 Day Project and I completed it Successfully.
