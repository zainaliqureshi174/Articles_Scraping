      "<p>  We’re excited to share the success of our first ever KS3 Geography competition, an event that challenged students to showcase their knowledge of world geography in an engaging and competitive format. Modeled on the classic \"Spelling Bee,\" the initiative tasked participants with identifying countries based on their flags, landmarks, and border outlines - a true test of geographical literacy and global awareness.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>\"Many of our students have a curiosity about the world, and we want to encourage them to be global citizens and have an understanding of countries and places far away from home,\" says Mr Haslam, Geography and Humanities teacher who helped bring the competition to life. This sentiment lies at the heart of the event, as our school is committed to nurturing students' interest in diverse cultures that define nations across the globe.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>By challenging young geographers to recognise the unique identifiers of different countries, the competition encouraged them to delve deeper into the intricacies of world geography. From the striking colours and symbols of national flags to the iconic landmarks that have become synonymous with certain regions, each round presented an opportunity for the participants to showcase their knowledge and appreciation for the world around them.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>The competition saw students from years 6, 7 and 8 step up to the challenge, their faces alight with concentration as they strived to outpace their peers. The friendly rivalry in the room was met with enthusiastic cheers and encouragement from the audience of fellow students, as they passionately supported their friends.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>\"I was really nervous at first, but as the competition went on, I found myself getting more excited to identify the countries,\" shared one participant in year 7. \"It made me want to learn even more about the different landmarks and countries.\"</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>Initiatives like this Geography Competition are vital for igniting students' curiosity about global affairs and empowering them to become engaged, well-informed citizens. By challenging our young minds to recognise the defining characteristics of nations, our teachers can foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for the diversity that exists beyond our students’ immediate surroundings.</p><p>    </p>\n",

      "<p>  The recently concluded academic year was marked by a significant milestone for our year 6 and year 8 students, as they celebrated their graduation in a grand ceremony held on Wednesday, 26 June 2024. The event was a celebration of the hard work, dedication, and achievements of our students, who are now ready to embark on their next academic endeavours.</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>The ceremony was a celebration of academic excellence and a recognition of our students' well-rounded development. Awards were presented in various categories, including subject-specific awards, as well as the prestigious \"Student of the Year\" accolade, which was awarded to Belinda Hui, a shining example of academic and personal growth.</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>The evening was filled with a diverse range of performances by our students, including a rendition of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Fantasia in D minor, while the year 8 students treated the audience to a soulful performance of Maroon 5's \"Memories.\" Additionally, the year 6 students sang a touching performance of the Chinese song \"再见 / Goodbye.\"</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>One of the highlights of the evening was the heartwarming and light-hearted videos showcased during the ceremony. Year 6 students delighted the audience with a playful video in which they impersonated their teachers, a testament to the strong bonds and mutual understanding they have developed over the year.</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>As Headmaster Robert Fox aptly stated, \"There was a lovely atmosphere in the room with a perfect balance between the formal prize giving and presentations alongside a range of musical performances. A highlight for many was the Year 6 video which showed just how well the children know their teachers as well as a poignant closing performance by all pupils in Year 8 singing 'Memories' - there was barely a dry eye in the house, testament to the friendships the children have made over the course of the last few years as well as the strong relationships developed by the pupils and staff.\"</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>Lastly, the year 6 and year 8 prefects delivered heartfelt speeches, reflecting on their journeys and the invaluable lessons they have learned during their time at the school.</p><p></p><p>As the graduates prepare to embark on their next academic adventures - whether at renowned institutions like Eton College, Badminton, or Rugby School, or continue their studies with us, or other top secondary schools in Hong Kong - Headmaster Robert Fox expressed his well-wishes, stating, \"We wish them all well as they move on to their next adventures in Hong Kong and overseas. They are certainly ready for the next challenge, and I am sure they will make the most of the opportunities that await them.”</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>Our school community is filled with pride and excitement as our year 6 and year 8 students take their next big steps towards their future endeavours.</p><p></p><p>                 </p>\n",

      "<p>  At the end of our final term in June, our community was treated to an evening of musical theatre magic, with a variety of screen-to-show performances in our summer musical: Lights, Camera, Broadway! Each year group performed a song from a well-known Broadway musical, from The Greatest Showman to School of Rock to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It was a celebration of the performing arts, and a fantastic way to cap off another wonderful year.</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>Alongside the summer show, we hosted our annual art fair which provided the perfect prelude to the show.

      "<p>  This past July, we partnered with BE Education to offer a 4-week Intensive English Programme for non-native English-speaking children aged 7-13, open to students from China and surrounding areas. The course was a great success, leaving the children and their families inspired and eager for the upcoming academic year.</p><p></p><p>Taught by one of our Wycombe Abbey Hong Kong teachers, the summer curriculum focused on elevating students' written and spoken English skills through dynamic, engaging lessons. Building practical language skills also helps bolster students' confidence - an equally vital component of their development and English-speaking journeys. With class sizes kept small, the programme provided each child with personalised attention and support – a key tenet of the teaching methodologies employed by both Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong and BE Education.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>\"We were thrilled to collaborate with BE Education to bring this invaluable learning opportunity to students across Hong Kong and China this summer,\" said Rob Fox, Headmaster. \"At our school, we are always seeking new avenues to help young minds develop their language abilities. I was delighted with the significant improvement the students made over the course of the four weeks.\"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, participants demonstrated impressive progress in their English proficiency. Beyond the academic gains, the children also reported increased confidence and enthusiasm for learning English.</p><p></p><p>With the summer programme now complete, we're looking forward to next year’s offering. \"The feedback from students and parents has been positive,\" added George Loup, BE's Hong Kong Area Manager. \"We're excited to build on this success and continue empowering young learners to strengthen their English abilities.”</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>Languages at Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong:</p><p></p><p>At our school, we place equal emphasis on the development of both English and Mandarin language skills. Our weekly timetable includes the same amount of dedicated instructional time for each language - a key differentiator from many top British schools in Hong Kong.</p><p></p><p>By devoting 7 periods per week to both English and Mandarin, we aim to ensure our students receive a bilingual education that prepares them for an increasingly globalised world.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>In addition to our rigorous language curriculum, we also offer an Intensive English programme aimed at supporting capable students who require additional help strengthening their English skills. During their first 6 months at our school, these students undergo immersive instruction to rapidly develop their English proficiency, aiming to help them seamlessly transition into our mainstream classes thereafter.</p><p>    </p>\n",

      "Productive and Fun Ways to Spend the Last Weeks of Summer\n",
      "<p>  With just under three weeks left of the summer holiday for Wycombe Abbey Hong Kong students, it's the perfect time to start warming up those brains! But don't worry, it's still possible to enjoy the summer break by engaging in fun activities that complement your academic journey at the same time. To make the most of your last three weeks of summer, consider trying out these at-home activities that are not only enriching, but also enjoyable across various subject areas - proving that you can be productive while having fun at the same time!</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>iSTEAM</p><p>For the budding engineers, challenge yourself to design and construct your own marble run using cardboard tubes, tape, and marbles, or create a robotic arm with household items like popsicle sticks and rubber bands! These projects will not only enhance your iSTEAM skills in preparation for the new term, but also get you into the problem-solving mindset you’ll need for iSTEAM.</p><p></p><p>Speech and Drama</p><p>Transform your living room into a stage and write, direct, and perform your own short play or comedy sketch. Make use of household props and costumes to bring your play to life. You could invite one of your classmates over to perform with you too! This will not only help improve your public speaking and performance skills but also spark your imagination and teamwork abilities you’ll be using in Drama.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>Music</p><p>Inspire your musical talents by composing your own song or creating a musical instrument using everyday objects, such as rubber bands, bottles, or even metal spoons. Gather your family members for a family talent show, where you can share your instrument-playing or vocal abilities. We provide many opportunities to perform in front of live audiences throughout the year, including our spring concert, summer show and WASHK’s Got Talent! Why not get practicing?</p><p></p><p>Humanities</p><p>Ignite your curiosity about the world by planning a virtual \"tour\" of a renowned museum or historical site that interests you, such as The Eiffel Tour, Stone Henge or Machu Picchu. Create a presentation to share with your family. You’ll be the school expert for a particular historical site upon returning to school! You'll also develop your research and communication skills needed in History and Geography.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>Mathematics</p><p>Ask your sibling or parents to create a maths-themed scavenger hunt around the house, where you need to solve mathematical equations to find your next clue. You can also challenge yourself to design your own board game or puzzle, incorporating mathematical concepts you learned last academic year in a fun and engaging way. Invite one of your classmates over to play it with you!</p><p></p><p>Chinese</p><p>Learn the ancient art of paper cutting. Grab some colorful sheets of paper and use small scissors to carefully snip away, creating intricate silhouettes and designs that have been used for centuries to decorate homes during festivals. Once you've mastered the basic techniques, challenge yourself to cut out Chinese symbols, landscapes, or even your zodiac animal. Display your delicate paper cuttings around your home or bring them to school to share with your Chinese teacher!</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>English</p><p>Create a family book club where everyone shares their thoughts on a chosen book. This will help with your discussion and critical thinking skills, and you can also watch the movie adaptation together afterwards accompanied by some freshly popped popcorn! You could also challenge yourself to write your own short story or poem. When the new school year begins, consider sharing your work with your English teacher or our school librarian to keep in our library! This will help develop the writing skills that are essential for your English classes.</p><p></p><p>Art</p><p>Challenge yourself to draw detailed portraits of your family members or pets. If you're feeling ambitious, sculpt a small figurine out of clay or even repurpose household items like wire, cardboard, or recycled materials. Display your art pieces around your home or give them as gifts to family and friends! The process of experimenting with different techniques can unlock your creative mindset you’ll be using in Art.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>Sport</p><p>Sharpen your football skills like Lionel Messi by setting up a dribbling course if you have the space. Weave in and out of cones (or water bottles), practice your stepovers, and work on bending shots into a makeshift goal. Incorporate agility ladder drills and sprints too! Challenging yourself to Messi-inspired skills and fitness will keep you sharp and fit your PE classes and ECAs.</p><p></p><p>We encourage you to embrace the final weeks of summer by engaging in activities that are both enjoyable and productive. This will help you feel refreshed and energized, putting you at an advantage when the new academic year begins, so you can hit the ground running.</p><p>    </p>\n"
