Falling in love with learning at WASHK ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/1103/Falling-in-love-with-learning-at-WASHK,"<p>Emma Vanbergen is a mother of three children. Having spent the past 18 years in China, Emma recently moved to Hong Kong with her family. When deciding on the right school for Sebastian (Year 2) and Alexia (Year 1) , Emma chose Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong as the place for her children to be. What made WASHK the school of choice for Emma and her children? </p><p>    Emma and her three children</p><p>  A Balance of Excellent Chinese & English</p><p>  My first principle in choosing a school for my children is that the school’s Chinese and English curriculum must be equally balanced and excellent.</p><p></p><p>In today’s world, Chinese and English are equally important. As a British family living in China, I believe that children should learn to be fluent in both languages. Sebastian’s first school prior to WASHK did not quite meet my expectations for this, and after much research, I decided to enroll Sebastian to Wycombe Abbey.</p><p></p><p>Before Sebastian started at WASHK, he had not learned Chinese phonetics. Although he could speak Putonghua, he could only read a few words. Now, after a year at Wycombe Abbey, I personally feel his progress in Chinese has rapidly improved. He can read stories and books in Chinese, and write in Chinese, which has exceeded my expectations.</p><p>  I attribute this growth in Sebastian to the immersive language environment at Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong. Sebastian tells me that during Chinese classes at WASHK, the teachers only speak in Chinese, and not a “Chinese-English” mix, thus creating an engaging classroom concentrated on pure Chinese.</p><p></p><p>Chinese is taught daily, with all Chinese classes taught in Putonghua, with simplified characters for reading and writing Chinese.</p><p>  With the success witnessed with Sebastian, I was more than happy to let Alexia follow her brother’s footstep. It was a big step for Alexia because prior to joining Wycombe Abbey, she had many months of pre-school remote learning (due to COVID) where there was very few chances for social interactions. </p><p></p><p>I think Alexia really enjoys this aspect of school life since starting here, she often come home after school and talks about her friends.</p><p>  Learning Effectively</p><p></p><p>The process of effective learning is easier said than done, and it is often difficult to achieve the balance of motivation, academics, and engagement. I feel that children studying at WASHK are happy, while being challenged each day to build character and resilience. </p><p></p><p>Every teacher at Wycombe Abbey has his/her unique ways of tapping into what children love, and cleverly integrating their passions into the classrooms to stimulate that interest in learning. This is precisely the golden key to the door of effective learning. </p><p>    Sebastian loves insects, and in the first few Chinese classes, the teacher’s topic revolved around insects – how they move, how they fly, how unique their shapes are…Sebastian was so fascinated that he came home and excitedly told me, “My Chinese teacher is awesome!”. </p><p></p><p>Now Sebastian is also learning poetry and Chinese literature, which he thoroughly enjoys. Although it’s not insects, the fact that the teacher was able to spark an intimate level of interest to Chinese through Sebastian’s love for insects, has translated to a thriving teacher/student relationship.</p><p>    Sebastian also loves science, and anything related to science, such as coding and programming. Although it may seem difficult for a 6-year-old, the school does a great job of incorporating fun games such as Minecraft into the STEM curriculum. </p><p></p><p>Sebastian would play for hours, and at first, I did not realize that he was actually “learning”. After seeing how the game is in fact, built into the curriculum, I now can see the effectiveness of learning through shared interests and relevant engagement, something WASHK has managed to achieve successfully.</p><p>    Personalised Teaching</p><p>  Another reason I decided to choose Wycombe Abbey for Sebastian, was because Sebastian’s previous school did not really offer personalised teaching. </p><p></p><p>At his previous school, Sebastian was a bit ahead on some subjects compared to his classmates, but his teacher did not offer any special or personalised teaching to cater to Sebastian’s advanced level. There was a time when Sebastian complained to me and felt that he was hardly learning anything at school.</p><p></p><p>Since we have joined WASHK, it has been very different. Because of the small class sizes, teachers have more capacity to tend and tailor to each child’s academic level and learning potential. </p><p></p><p>For example, Sebastian’s daily vocabulary lists is different than his classmates’. Although this may seem like a small detail to highlight, it is very important, and goes to show that even with small matters as such, the teachers at WASHK will go above and beyond to customize different schedules and programs based on each child’s academic needs.</p><p>    In addition, the teachers at WASHK also take into consideration each child’s learning style.</p><p></p><p>Sebastian likes to take things step by step when he is learning, setting clear goals for himself and achieving his goals with this method. His teachers at WASHK fully understand this and has adjusted the ways in which they communicate and teach Sebastian so he can fully engage and learn. Instead of making the student adjust to the teacher’s way of teaching, it is the other way around. This method of personalised teaching allows Sebastian to reach his maximum potential and allows him to express himself and a safe and nurturing environment.</p><p>    Emma's three children</p><p>  Alexia happens to be taught by the same class teacher who taught Sebastian last year, so I can see how each child is motivated differently according to their own personalities. Alexia enjoys helping others, and was recently awarded the “Start of the week” for helping others in class, she was super proud about this and it really helped fuel her motivation. She is now settling nicely into her daily routines with daily spelling homework and she enjoys having a go figuring out words in her story books. </p><p></p><p>As a parent, I appreciate this very much, and the teaching staff at WASHK has been exemplary.</p><p>  British Prep School Ethos</p><p>  Although it’s still early, I do plan to have Sebastian and Alexia attend boarding school in the UK once he is old enough to do so. Normally that is around age 13. Finding a British prep school in Hong Kong to help prepare Sebastian for boarding school was very important. With Wycombe Abbey’s outstanding reputation in the UK, and WASHK’s British prep school ethos, I believe WASHK is the perfect school for Sebastian’s transition to the UK.</p><p></p><p>I was ecstatic to hear the good news that Wycombe Abbey Hong Kong has opened Year 7 and Year 8 this August. This is accompanied by the school’s Secondary School Guidance Programme, which is an in-house programme designed to help support students and their families who are interested in transitioning to top boarding schools and secondary schools in the UK and the world.  </p><p></p><p>When Sebastian finishes Year 8 at WASHK, he will be fully prepared for his transition to boarding school in the UK. The same is in the plan for Alexia.</p><p>    Mr. Tuckett, the Headmaster of Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong, has had extensive experience of leading British preparatory schools, knows very well how to prepare children for Common Entrance exams, school admissions interviews, and various critical stages of their education. </p><p></p><p>Although the Secondary School Guidance Programme just began this year, he has already helped many Wycombe Abbey Hong Kong students receive placement offers to some of the top boarding schools in the UK, including two current student offers to Wycombe Abbey U</p><p>K, one of the best academically and most difficult secondary schools to get in the UK.</p><p>    I fully recommend Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong to parents who are interested in having their children learn in an immersive and gregarious environment, where children are happy, and the teachers truly care. </p><p></p><p>If you are considering boarding school for your child in the future, Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong is an excellent school to prepare your child for this transition.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/emma.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/emma1.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/emma2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/emma3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/emma4.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/emma5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/emma6.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/emma7.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/emma8.jpg"">"
Breathing new life into my children ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/1105/Breathing-new-life-into-my-children,"<p>Nicola is a mother of four daughters. With the eldest three daughters studying at Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong (Lucy in Year 7, Lily in Year 5 and Leah in Year 2). So why did Nicola choose Wycombe as the place to be for her daughters？ </p><p>  My daughters went to local schools prior to switching to Wycombe Abbey. I felt they never quite fit into the traditional local school culture, in which the children were relentlessly measured by academic results. I felt my children were being deprived of a proper childhood, and I decided it was not how my children will be brought up.</p><p>  The Importance of Chinese Culture</p><p>  Choosing schools is no easy task.</p><p>    There are many international schools in Hong Kong, but I felt most of them are very much geared towards educating expatriates. As for local students studying there, the risks of them losing touch with their own language, culture and heritage are real.</p><p></p><p>I want my children to be brought up with a western-style education without losing sense of their background. It is very important for my children to retain their Chinese, so they can become an effective bridge that connects the East and the West.</p><p>  I’ve found that Wycombe Abbey was able to provide this environment for my children.</p><p></p><p>The critical determining factor for choosing Wycombe Abbey is their emphasis on the importance of learning Chinese. Chinese is taught daily, with 7 lessons of Chinese per week. This is incredibly helpful in my children’s development to be fluently bilingual.</p><p>    Children are full of life now</p><p>I am no “Tiger Mom”, but I do care about my children’s learning environment, and their mental and social well-being. I care about whether my children can distinguish what is right from wrong, and how to become the best version of themselves.</p><p></p><p>The biggest change I have observed since my children joined this school is their liveliness and motivation to be in class every day.  I can see the spirit in their eyes.</p><p>    In their previous schools, I have seen how Lily and Leah sat at their desks seemingly listening to teachers, but I had no idea how much they really learned. Now, Lily often shares with me all the new things she has learned at school. The depth of her knowledge far exceeds my expectations for a Year 5 student. Her attitude and approach towards learning has totally changed, for the better.</p><p>    For Leah, she used to be quite timid and was afraid to try new things. Now, she will happily attempt challenges knowing full well she will make mistakes. I think she is beginning to enjoy the process as well.</p><p></p><p>Such significant changes cannot be brought about without the school’s pro-active and positive style of education. Teachers won’t decide top down what is right or wrong, but rather encourage the children to come to conclusions on their own. Such an open and low-pressure environment is truly valuable and refreshing!</p><p>    As for our eldest daughter Lucy, she was doing okay at her previous local school, but since we have plans to send her to UK for boarding school from Y9 (age 13), we wanted Lucy to switch to a UK curriculum school earlier, and get herself familiarised with the UK style of teaching and learning. We felt Wycombe Abbey was the closest thing to a UK prep school, without actually needing to go to the UK, and hopefully the school can also help her secure offers from our preferred schools. </p><p></p><p>My husband and I are really satisfied at how Wycombe Abbey is preparing Lucy since she joined last year, and we must also thank the school for helping Lucy secure an offer from our first choice, Rugby School!</p><p>    Rugby School</p><p></p><p>Rugby is a public school, one of the nine prestigious schools investigated by the Clarendon Commission of 1861-64. The game of Rugby football owes its name to the school. In 1823, William Webb Ellis, a student of the school at that time, invented the sport and named it after the school. Today, Rugby School is recognized as one of the top senior schools in the UK for boys and girls.</p><p>  The Headmaster is a real educator</p><p>  I have met and conversed with many headmasters in the past. My impression was that some can really talk the talk, mesmerising parents with pupil statistics, academic accolades, competitive achievements and marketing terminologies.</p><p></p><p>I didn’t see this in Mr. Tuckett. He did not use numbers and statistics to describe the school, but shared his views on pupils’ personalities, interests and his education philosophy which focused on each child’s individuality.</p><p>    Reflecting on the above, the school’s end of term reports include two types of grades; one reflecting the level of academic knowledge, the other on the pupil’s effort. Both are of equal importance and are closely related. Pupils understand that the more effort they put in, the better their results will be.</p><p>    Learning in this environment, I think my children will develop self-respect, confidence, and an opportunity to reach their potential, maybe even inspiring others to do the same.</p><p></p><p>Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong opened in September 2019. With the mother school in the UK, and sister schools in Changzhou, Hangzhou and Nanjing, I think it provides good progression options for families who are considering sending their children abroad for further schooling. Their teaching staff is full of energy and this energy transcends onto my children, filling them with a childhood full of “L”ife. I will definitely recommend my friends to come visit Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong to find out more.</p><p>   </p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Wycombe%20Abbey_Nicola1.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Wycombe%20Abbey_Nicola2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Wycombe%20Abbey_Nicola3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Wycombe%20Abbey_Nicola4.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Wycombe%20Abbey_Nicola5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Wycombe%20Abbey_Nicola6.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Wycombe%20Abbey_Nicola7.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Wycombe%20Abbey_Nicola8.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/DSC_0092_ps-1024x684.jpg"">"
From “don’t make mistakes” to “give it a try” ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/1109/From-%E2%80%9Cdon%E2%80%99t-make-mistakes%E2%80%9D-to-%E2%80%9Cgive-it-a-try%E2%80%9D,"<p>Angela is mother of two children studying at Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong. Spencer in Year 2 and Serena in Year 5. She shares with us how her children have been positively transformed after joining the school. </p><p>    Like many other local parents, to us choosing a primary school is a big decision. We were really excited and counted ourselves very lucky when Serena and Spencer were both accepted by top local primary schools. Our long-term plan is to send children abroad at a later stage, so it was a “wait and see” approach with regards to how long we should keep them at local schools.</p><p>The trigger for our decision to switch schools actually came from our younger son Spencer. He is naturally curious and can be naughty sometimes. He is not the type that can sit tight and listen through a 40mins lesson without asking any questions.</p><p></p><p>It did not take long for us to realise he did not fit into his school.</p><p>                            His start to school life also coincided with COVID-19 and lots of remote learning. I was able to witness how Spencer’s teachers interacted with him and I thought it wasn’t what I want for him. The stress level was very high from both sides and I knew he wasn’t motivated. Teachers were very traditional and adopted a top down approach to teaching.</p><p></p><p>The defining moment came one day when I found a Lego Minifigure in his uniform pocket. I asked him about this and his answer broke my heart.</p><p>  He said he dreaded going to school and the only way he could seek comfort at school was to touch the Minifigure in his pocket without being seen and think about the joy of playing Lego at home! </p><p>                                           My immediate response was equally shocking in hindsight. I told him to make sure teachers don’t find out about this, or you could be penalized. Later that day I realized I have already become a victim of the system, instead of protecting my son’s emotional wellbeing I was actually standing against him.  </p><p></p><p>We started looking for a school for Spencer that he would enjoy.</p><p></p><p>My sister knew of Wycombe Abbey’s renowned reputation in the UK and with her suggestion we toured their campus in Hong Kong. We really liked the cozy and friendly feel of the place, plus the British curriculum and teaching team we met, and after receiving an offer for the following academic year we thought long and hard whether to switch Spencer over immediately or wait until September.</p><p>      We thought of letting him complete a year before changing school, it was the more “proper” way, but my husband and I knew in our hearts the right thing to do was to switch immediately, and thank goodness we did. </p><p></p><p>Returning from his first day at WASHK, he came home and declared to me “Okay, I am happy”. His class teacher also gave us much reassurance after the first day, she told us “If no one told me it was his first day I would not have suspected that was the case”.</p><p></p><p>After two months, I observed dramatic changes in his behaviours. He started talking to me about things he learnt at school, he often began speaking to me with “Did you know that…” and I saw him trying to find answers to questions by conducting research online by himself, one day he even spoke with impressive depth of knowledge about the differences between a crocodile and an alligator.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly though, we knew he was happier.</p><p>    Other family members also noticed these changes with Spencer; he speaks freely during dinner times which are now very interactive, we discuss things that he could try at school’s ECA sessions.</p><p></p><p>Recently, he asked if he can join the badminton ECA, I asked him why this sudden interest in badminton, he shrugged and gave me a response I would never have expected from the previous Spencer we knew.</p><p></p><p>“I just want to give it a try”.</p><p></p><p>I feel WASHK has helped Spencer re-ignite his sense of adventure and curiosity, elements I feel that are essential for a sustainable, lifelong learning journey.</p><p>    After the successful transition of Spencer, our attention turned towards our elder daughter Serena, who has been quietly going to school and trying her best to stay out of trouble in a strict, high pressure all-girls school.</p><p></p><p>She is naturally quiet, reserved and enjoys staying in the background of things, an introvert in other words. She also holds high standards for herself and does not like it when things are not perfect.</p><p></p><p>She also saw what was happening to Spencer and wanted to follow suit. We let her try a summer camp programme at WASHK, after which she was sure she wanted to change too.</p><p>    After joining WASHK, I can see her changing as well. One day she came home and said in a casual but surprising manner that “Actually mom, Maths could be fun”.</p><p></p><p>I realized then that Serena’s previous view on studying is that it could not be fun, and I thought to myself “How sad was that?”</p><p></p><p>She is much more at ease with herself now and regularly speaks her mind. In the past, Serena was always trying her best to stay out of sight, don’t make mistakes, don’t get scolded.</p><p></p><p>Now at Wycombe Abbey, thanks to the small class size and amazing teacher to student ratio, she receives a lot of attention from teachers, there is literally nowhere to hide, and Serena has to speak in class, and with just that, her self-confidence starting growing.</p><p>    At her previous school, speaking quietly in class meant receiving a low score. Here, speaking quietly means getting more attention from teachers!</p><p></p><p>I don’t think my children’s transformation could have taken place at a 1,000 plus student campus, where individuals rarely get the attentions they need. Here, everyone knows each other (the campus’ capacity is approx. 600).</p><p>    The other day, Spencer dropped his school bus pass somewhere in the campus on his way home (as kids do), and without any fuss, questions of any sort, the pass was handed back to him by a caring staff the following day, just like how it works in a family.</p><p></p><p>We are really happy we made the decisions we did and I hope our children will continue to excel here, we look forward to, and support the school’s application for Year 9-13 going forward.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Store1-1.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Serena%20Spencer/image-20220616-020923-1d09c73f.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Serena%20Spencer/image-20220617-024531-33077934.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Store1-3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Serena%20Spencer/20220207_161826.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Store1-5.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Store1-6.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Store1-7.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Store1-8.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Store1-9.jpg"">"
Compassionate teachers+small class sizes=WASHK is for us! ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/1113/Compassionate-teachers-small-class-sizes-WASHK-is-for-us!,"<p>Jennifer is from the United States and Philip is from England. Their son Oliver is currently a Year 4 student at Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong. </p><p>                                          Tell us a little bit about your family? How was your move and transition to Hong Kong?</p><p></p><p>Jennifer：</p><p></p><p>I’m originally from the US and Philip is from England. My husband and I met when we were in graduate school in the US. We’ve always been a traveling family, even when we had Oliver. When Oliver was 14 months old, we move to Amsterdam for work. We spent Oliver’s earlier years in the Netherlands up until preschool. We then relocated to Tokyo, where we spent the last few years before moving to Hong Kong in late 2020.</p><p></p><p>Philip：</p><p></p><p>Oliver went to an international school when we were living in Tokyo, where academics, pastoral care and family support was an important part of the school. When we found out we would be relocating to Hong Kong, we began searching for a school with reputable academics but also a focus on personal and social development. We had some friends that recently relocated to Hong Kong, and they encouraged us to start our search for Oliver’s new school ASAP.</p><p>                    Why WASHK for Oliver? How was the application process? How did WASHK compared to other schools you looked at?</p><p></p><p>Jennifer：</p><p></p><p>Once we got connected, the school was very accommodating throughout the application process, especially with our mid-year transition during a pandemic. We spoke with Mr. Tuckett, the Headmaster, who was very passionate. He is a truly dedicated educator who cares about the growth of each individual child. He shared his vision of opening a school in Hong Kong committed to providing the very best of British education and a school environment encouraging children to be independent and well rounded.</p><p></p><p>Philip：</p><p></p><p>When we were choosing schools, we were deciding between WASHK and another school. Although the other school offered many of the characteristics we were looking for, but it felt very “manufactured” to us, almost operating in a conveyor belt system. Then we interacted with WASHK and their teachers, we were so touched by how personable and caring they were. They made Oliver and our family feel so welcomed, and we found the quaint and cozy community feeling we had been searching for.</p><p>    How’s school life for your family and Oliver? Share a few words about what you like best about WASHK? What offers and services from the school did/do you and your family find helpful and supportive?</p><p></p><p>Philip：</p><p></p><p>The small class sizes are very favourable. The teacher-student ratio is outstanding. There is a lot of support and the teachers really know the children well. Ms. Snyder, Oliver’s current class teacher in Year 4, has really picked up on Oliver’s tendencies which in turn, has led to Oliver’s improvements both academically and personally.</p><p></p><p>For example, Oliver attended a Dutch preschool when we were in the Netherlands and an international school in Tokyo. Although we speak English at home and Oliver has had exposure to many languages, we would like Oliver to develop some fluency in a second language and take advantage of our time in Asia.</p><p></p><p>Since coming to WASHK, Oliver’s Chinese has improved tremendously. We have been so impressed with his Chinese, it is truly beyond our expectations. In less than a year’s time, Oliver now has developed ability to recognize and read characters confidently, while conversing with his classmates in Mandarin on a daily basis.</p><p>          Jennifer：</p><p></p><p>The small class sizes enables the teachers to give special attention to each individual student. Even the school’s specialist subject teachers are very attentive.</p><p></p><p>We recently visited the school during Parent’s Night, and spoke with Oliver’s iSTEAM teacher, Mr. Janjua. While Mr. Janjua complimented on Oliver’s academic performance in the classroom, he also mentioned that Oliver’s soft people skills of encouraging others and supporting his classmates as his “strongest” trait. The fact that Mr. Janjua referred to Oliver’s soft skills as his most commendable skill is a clear indication of the high level of empathy and care the teachers at WASHK have for their students.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Philip：</p><p></p><p>We had some hesitations when we first moved to HK and came to Wycombe. Coming from a much larger international school in Tokyo, there was some concerns to whether Oliver could adapt and fit in. The transition has been surprisingly pleasant. While it has been harder to socialize during COVID times, the school is certainly trying and has done a great job despite these circumstances.</p><p></p><p>In particular the after-school programme has done wonders for Oliver. Oliver really loves iSTEAM and all the extraordinary science and technology related projects Mr. Janjua leads them to do each week. Oliver also joined Senior Choir and loves singing and performing with his classmates. The school recently hosted a Spelling Bee competition on campus in which Oliver competed in as well! It has really been encouraging for Oliver to participate in all these opportunities to engage with his classmates and community.</p><p>                                                   What advice would you give to other families considering WASHK for their children?</p><p></p><p>Jennifer & Philip：</p><p></p><p>While the relative strength of the school is to assist students with their transition to the most prestigious secondary schools in the UK, we believe the school does an incredibly good job in preparing students to transition onto ANY education pathway they decide to choose.</p><p></p><p>We feel that Oliver will be very well prepared no matter which pathway(s) we choose in the future.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Story2-1-2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Story2-1.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Story2-1-3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Story2-2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Oliver%20Gorham/20220615_163411.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Story2-3-1.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Story2-3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Story2-4.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Story2-5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Story2-6-1.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Story2-6.jpg"">"
Duncan found himself,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/1121/Duncan-found-himself-at-Wycombe-Abbey-School-Hong-Kong,"<p>  Duncan is currently a Y8 student at WASHK. He has successfully obtained multiple offers from UK boarding schools starting next year. Duncan’s parents would like to share how WASHK has helped Duncan mature and develop during the past academic year.</p><p>    Duncan’s father:</p><p>  Duncan is the elder of our two children, his younger sister and him were studying at the same school before he joined WASHK. It was a very big school, and combined with prolonged periods of remote learning he did not feel connected to that community. After some serious family discussions, we decided that it was best Duncan started to prepare himself to further his studies at a boarding school in the UK from Y9, and hence began our search for a school that can help Duncan achieve this goal.</p><p>      We looked at various schools in Hong Kong, particular those operating a UK curriculum and had the chance to meet with a family whose children were studying at Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong. We felt this school, despite only having Y8 as their most senior year, was most aligned with our objective. When their Headmaster, Mr. Tuckett told us that his mission was to “help every student obtain the best offers from senior schools around the world, particularly in the UK” we knew it would be a good fit.</p><p>  Duncan joined a relatively small class with 13 other students, and befriended two other boys quickly. It was very convenient because the other two boys were also preparing for UK boarding schools so they formed really strong bonds with a common mission amongst the trio.</p><p>    In his previous schools, students were openly streamed into high performing Vs mediocre groups, or many students were exclusively labelled from a young age (swimming team, choir, orchestra etc.). Others were selected to achieve high public exam scores, there was a general feeling radiated onto us that our child was lucky to get into the school, and the school will decide which areas he will perform in. Duncan is naturally competitive and likes to win, so when his school directed him to do something he would just go do it and try his best, sometimes without really considering whether he liked to do it. Here at WASHK, we felt the school deliberately leave a lot of thinking and feeling space for students. There are no labels, students are given equal opportunities to try many things, and then to decide for themselves what they really like, what they are good at, and if they want to further pursue particular skills going forward. Students are also under no pressure to express why they do not like certain things.</p><p>If we can use a single sentence to describe his experience here, it would be that WASHK enabled Duncan to “find his true self”.</p><p>      The school runs a broad curriculum with 14 subjects, naturally there are some that Duncan likes more than others. He likes Maths, Science and iSTEAM, but he doesn’t like Drama. We asked him why he doesn’t like Drama, and we were actually very impressed with the answer he gave, he told us “I don’t understand the logic behind getting a group of individuals together to rehearse and act out some scenes that are not real, it feels like we are encouraged to do a lot of pretending and faking our emotions.”</p><p>  I remember in the past, when Duncan told us he didn’t like certain subjects, it was often due to the subject being boring, hard, or the teacher wasn’t nice. In hindsight, we can see these are superficial and shallow reasons. But when Duncan explained his thoughts about Drama, we knew he actually experienced the essence of the subject itself, and came to a rational conclusion of his likes and disliked. In other words, Duncan was developing critical thinking, and was able to assess subjects, situations and people more independently. We firmly believe this is down to the “no label” philosophy of the school, the positive mentality of teachers, plus the small class sizes. They come together to create a school where students are not just encouraged to learn and know things, but to think.</p><p>  Duncan likes sports, and he relishes his three P.E. lessons every week. He tells us that P.E. at WASHK is different from his previous schools, because in the past P.E. was more about learning a particular discipline of sports and doing them well, then going out there to compete and win trophies. Here, it is more about “Physical Literacy”. He likes basketball a lot, and given a traditional mindset school I assume Duncan will be drafted into the team and encouraged to focus on that particular sport. In contrast, at WASHK, I know that during last year Duncan was exposed to many new sports that he would never have tried otherwise, from Netball (which is a girls’ sport!), Lacrosse, to Rugby. I can see he has a broader understanding of the concept of sports through P.E.</p><p>            We think WASHK does a very good job in preventing students from narrowing their interests and mindset too early. The school actively let students experience a wide variety of disciplines and encourage them to reach their own conclusions. We think this is very important because nowadays many children have their decisions made for them by parents, other adults or institutions.</p><p>  Mr. Parr, Duncan’s class teacher: “Duncan is a very able pupil and has a lot of insight to add to our class discussions and activities. He is full of energy and always ready to speak his mind, so it’s been great to see how, with guidance, he has learned to control that energy and make sure it is always focused towards the task at hand.”</p><p>  Academically WASHK strikes a good balance between encouraging students to do their best Vs having too much pressure on themselves. There are homework activities, tests, and exams, but not to a level where parents and tutors need to get involved. We see Duncan beginning to take ownership of his own studies. Just recently we were surprised to see Duncan declined my invitation to play computer games with him because “he has to study”. We tried again by enticing him to watch Korean TV dramas together as a family (which has been one of our regular past times), but Duncan again declined citing his needed to prepare for an upcoming test. Duncan has significantly matured since joining WASHK.</p><p>  Mr. Tuckett also helped us secure multiple offers from UK boarding schools for Duncan, his up-to-date insights are valuable during the school selection stage, and the school’s Common Entrance ECA also helped. We are now faced with a good problem with multiple offers, and we are sure Duncan will come to his own conclusion with regards to which school he prefers to go to next. </p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/20220614_164233.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/WhatsApp%20Image%202022-06-28%20at%205.29.59%20PM.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/WASHK-ceremony-018.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/20220614_164150.jpg https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/image-20220615-021214-04b7dac4.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/image-20220615-003344-75f6e6d8.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/image-20220615-024559-8283778f.jpeg https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/image-20220615-031354-0f0c43bc.jpeg https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/image-20220615-024754-026b9571.jpeg"">"
Truly Grateful seeing my children being nurtured here  ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/1123/Truly-Grateful-seeing-my-children-being-nurtured-here,"<p>  Katrina (Y6) and Kayden (Y4) joined WASHK in 2020 and have enjoyed two full academic years learning under the “Wycombe” way. Both children will be heading to the UK to further their education from the next academic year. Their mother describes how WASHK has instilled confidence and grit into her children.  </p><p></p><p>                 </p><p>  Anike: </p><p></p><p>Both my children had previously studied in local schools since young- single gender schools, and neither of them enjoyed their experience very much. Katrina was relentlessly under pressure to complete her homework and tests, whilst Kayden was under constant fear that he would be scolded if he did anything wrong. I was worried that their schools were not really motivating them to learn, and more importantly, were oblivious to their emotional well-being and character development.  </p><p></p><p>                  </p><p></p><p>How did you hear about Wycombe Abbey? </p><p></p><p>We knew of Wycombe Abbey School in the UK from my time living in the UK, it is such a famous school with an outstanding reputation, everyone knows Wycombe Abbey in the UK. When we learnt they have a sister school in Hong Kong (a Co-Ed as well), we wanted to visit the school right away. Our tour did not disappoint, we quickly applied, and Katrina and Kayden were assessed soon after. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Katrina did fine and was given a place quickly, but Kayden did not perform on the day. He is a sweet boy with a big heart and is truly empathetic, but for some reason on the day of the assessment, he wasn’t himself. I knew he had failed and was already looking for another school for him, when the school invited Kayden back for another assessment, because according to the teacher she did not see Kayden at his best. I thought ‘Wow, this school is giving my son a second chance not based on scores, but on how the teacher “sensed” Kayden was not performing to his potential on the day.’ I was both relieved and intrigued at the same time! I knew then, the teachers at WASHK are different from other schools. </p><p>            </p><p> </p><p>On his second attempt, Kayden was a lot more relaxed and passed the assessment. We have found our children a school that truly care, and try to understand their students’ educational motivations, and their emotional well-being. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>The transition was easy, thanks to the small class sizes and a superb teacher to student ratio. Within such a cozy environment, my kids found friends quickly. </p><p></p><p></p><p>From running away from difficulties, to stepping up against adversities - Kayden was fully transformed. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>Kayden never really enjoyed his previous school. It was a typical “all boys, all driven alpha- male environment”. It didn’t take long for my husband and I to sense he was giving up on learning, or on performing at all! Kayden is very capable, but he was running away from adversities. We were concerned but felt maybe that’s “just his personality”. </p><p></p><p></p><p>How wrong were we!  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>After coming to WASHK, we saw Kayden transform into a totally different person. Now, he is self-driven, gritty, and not afraid to be wrong or fail. In fact, he sees failure almost as a necessary step to learning. I don’t know how the school does it, maybe the way teachers encouraged him to adjust his mindset, or exposing Kayden to a broad curriculum helped, or maybe even by just letting Kayden walk past that huge climbing wall motivated him subliminally. He is a very keen climber, and can spend hours on the wall despite not reaching very high up! That, to me is the essence of the new Kayden, he just does not give- up, this mentality transcends across his entire well-being. I can see a confident boy with determination.  </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p>Teachers are partners, not preachers </p><p></p><p>I knew Kayden was on the right path when one day he came home and told me how much he likes his teachers, describing each one in detail; who likes what, who is good at what etc. The relationship between my children and teacher is something I haven’t seen before. WASHK teachers nurtured Kayden into a confident boy with little ego, the perfect balance in my view. </p><p></p><p>                  </p><p></p><p>From barely coping to excelling </p><p></p><p>Our elder daughter is caring, responsible and measured, but at the same time she is a good humoured teenager who likes to enjoy herself and have fun with her friends. She disliked the intense competitiveness and forced rankings at her previous schools, so when she joined WASHK and met her classmates, it was like landing on a new planet, only this time it felt like home coming. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Katrina likes art, and WASHK recently invited every student to take part in a painting competition for the school’s yearbook cover. I was amazed when Katrina invited her classmate over for a 2-night sleepover, so that they could spend 3 days creating their piece of work for submission. This tells me Katrina is maturing, and taking ownership of her work, and relationships. </p><p>                    </p><p></p><p>They won! Katrina was absolutely over the moon and now eagerly awaits the arrival of the yearbook where their painting will be on the cover. I think a key element of growing up is for the child to feel the appreciation of their effort. </p><p></p><p>                       </p><p></p><p>Headmaster knows the UK schools well </p><p></p><p>We always planned for our children to further their studies in the UK, and the Headmaster at WASHK helped us achieve this goal effectively. </p><p></p><p>                   </p><p>Contrary to our original strategy (which was to apply to many schools in order to increase the chances of success), Mr. Tuckett suggested we apply to no more than five schools. He knew many UK schools well, and we trusted his judgement. The result? Katrine received multiple offers, and after speaking to Mr. Tuckett again, we decided to go with Woldingham. We are grateful for his valuable advice.  </p><p></p><p>  </p><p>We highly recommend families to visit WASHK, and are thankful the school played such a critical part of our children’s lives.  </p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/image-20220616-022014-dd6190bb.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/IMG_8870.JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/IMG-20220609-WA0046.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/IMG-20220610-WA0004.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/20220601_133245.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/IMG_8890.JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/20220601_134942.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/IMG_8894%201.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/image-20220616-082236-6aa04952.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/IMG-20220610-WA0003.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/image-20220616-022228-fb004cb4.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/WASHK-ceremony-267.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/IMG_8891.JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/WASHK-ceremony-084.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Kayden%20Katrina/IMG_8868.JPG"">"
Preparing our daughter for school in the UK  ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/1125/Preparing-our-daughter-for-school-in-the-UK-,"<p>  Sonya is 11 years old and has two siblings. Sonya had been attending a local school before joining WASHK in Y6 last September. Her parents always planned to let Sonya study abroad in the UK at the right time, either entering at 11+ or 13+ grades for boarding. </p><p>                </p><p> </p><p>Choosing Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong </p><p></p><p>We knew Wycombe Abbey was coming to Hong Kong before it opened and then had friends whose children were studying there and enjoying the WASHK experience. We chose to switch Sonya last year because we wanted to find a school that could help her prepare for a boarding school in the UK. After looking at several schools, we firmly believed that WASHK was the school that can properly prepare her for the next chapter in her education path. </p><p></p><p></p><p>What we like about WASHK is that the school delivers an authentic UK curriculum, under a small class setting with a brilliant teacher to student ratio without sacrificing the Chinese language subject. Keeping up with Sonya’s existing Chinese language capabilities was important to us. As it turns out, WASHK’s Chinese syllabus is strong compared to many other international schools. Sonya was assigned to the native stream at WASHK and she was able to continue learning Mandarin in Simplified Chinese characters (the school’s Chinese teachers helped make the smooth transition from Traditional to Simplified characters).  </p><p> </p><p></p><p>Expertise and Preparations for UK School Entrance </p><p></p><p>Right from the beginning, we informed WASHK’s Headmaster, Mr. Howard Tuckett, that we wanted to prepare Sonya for further studies in the UK. We met with Mr. Tuckett several times, and found these meetings most helpful.  Mr. Tuckett has been in the UK boarding school circuit for many years; he has a wealth of information into such schools, and retains many connections there, offering insight that goes far beyond the schools’ websites, good school guides and many education consultants.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>Soon after our initial meeting with Mr. Tuckett, Sonya was invited to officially join the school’s secondary school guidance programme, and she was enrolled into a ‘Common Entrance’ ECA. Every week, Sonya was taught very focused and purposeful preparations for the UK ISEB exams. There were also mock interviews and other UK cultural etiquette sessions. It really helped Sonya to set goals for herself and enhance her confidence. We firmly believe that the expertise and preparation for UK boarding schools are unique features of WASHK and the school is fully committed to our needs and goals. </p><p></p><p>                    </p><p></p><p>Life at Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong </p><p></p><p>Overall we felt Sonya adapted to her new school well and was very happy being a part of the WASHK community. WASHK made her open up, became more confident, and she took more ownership of her learning. We saw an independent thinker emerging from within. These days, Sonya works under the assumption that there is always more than one right answer, and she has become more daring to take risks in answering questions.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>The teachers at WASHK are attentive and encouraging to their students’ growth, which helped instil a ‘growth mindset’ mentality into the students. We especially appreciate how the school takes into account the student’s efforts as well as academic scores in term reports. This gives Sonya an understanding that “I might not get an A in this subject today, but with my strong efforts , I am on the right track to keep improving.” </p><p>     </p><p></p><p>Sonya’s Class Teacher: </p><p></p><p>When Sonya first arrived she was very shy and wanted to stay out of my “radar” so to speak, but my style of teaching is really through group work, and I always want to get every student involved. Sonya is such a sweet child, she mingled and bonded with classmates easily. In recent months I saw her confidence really growing, and with that, came her ability to work with others. Now, she readily puts up her hand to answer questions in class. </p><p> </p><p>WASHK also allows its students to excel in all fields. The lack of labelling helps encourage each child to try different things to see if they enjoy it or not. Sonya’s favourite subjects include P.E. and iSTEAM. She participates in a diverse variety of sports at school, and enjoys the multitude of iSTEAM projects such as 3D printing, etc. She was also recently invited to join a small team of students to help build the WASHK campus in a Minecraft setting, a project led by the iSTEAM teacher for the School.   </p><p></p><p>                        </p><p>The past year was a very difficult for all students due to the interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Sonya has really benefited from being with WASHK. We feel that she is ready for her next chapter in the UK. We would highly recommend parents to send their children to WASHK, especially for those who want to have the UK study option at some point in the future. Obviously, if WASHK opens Y9 and beyond, that can only be good news too. </p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Sonya%20Fung/sonya1.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Sonya%20Fung/WASHK-ceremony-212.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Sonya%20Fung/WASHK-ceremony-022.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Sonya%20Fung/sonya2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Sonya%20Fung/WhatsApp%20Image%202022-05-30%20at%2011.29.48%20AM.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Sonya%20Fung/20220609_141503.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Sonya%20Fung/20220601_125818.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Sonya%20Fung/20220601_130737.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Sonya%20Fung/20220601_133054.jpg"">"
WASHK helped our children settle in Hong Kong   ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/1127/WASHK-helped-our-children-settle-in-Hong-Kong-,"<p>  Aoba, Takuto and Wakaba are originally from Japan, and travelled with family to Bangkok and Singapore, prior to living in Hong Kong. They joined WASHK in Y8, Y5 and Y2 in 2021, after successfully completing a fully online remote assessment. </p><p> </p><p>                      </p><p></p><p>Our children left Japan seven years ago and followed us to various countries due to my work. They attended international schools in Bangkok and Singapore, and now Hong Kong. Before we arrived here, we already knew of Wycombe Abbey Hong Kong because my former colleague works there. We visited the brand-new campus and were impressed that WASHK was a UK curriculum school that served predominantly local families (with about 30% of non-Chinese speaking students). We want our children to go to a school where they can experience the real Hong Kong, to understand the local culture, and learn Chinese whilst they are here. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>We did thorough due diligence on the school before committing, and had conversations with the Headmaster, Mr. Tuckett, as well. We liked his approach to education, the curriculum and felt the teaching staff were very international, friendly, at the same time can be firm and willing to discipline students if needed. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Our children fell into each of the respective Key Stages of the school, Aoba (eldest sister) was in Key Stage 3, Takuto (younger brother) in Key Stage 2, and Wakaba (youngest sister) in Key Stage 1. We have a privileged view across all the Key Stages, and saw clear distinctions between them, which gave us a lot of confidence as parents. </p><p></p><p></p><p>For our youngest, who is in Year 2, her class teacher, Mrs. Tan, is kind, always has time to listen and made Wakaba feel really safe. Wakaba soon felt confident and, in our mind, the most important thing about a child at her age was to enjoy going to school. </p><p></p><p>                   </p><p></p><p>For Takuto who is in Year 5, the atmosphere of the classroom is different, it’s more about encouraging students to work together, to ask questions, try figuring out answers by themselves, and his class teacher, Mr. Mitchell sets a higher bar of academic standards compared to Key Stage 1. In fact, we can say with first-hand knowledge that WASHK as a school sets a higher academic standard compared to the other schools our children attended in the past. His class teacher really knows Takuto well and uses his interest to drive him forward. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Mr. Mitchell on Takuto: “Takuto is an enthusiastic, sociable student who lives for baseball. He has a competitive spirit and always gets excited when activities are framed as games or competitions. He is a caring and loyal friend and is universally liked by his peers. When he arrived at Wycombe Abbey he was initially quite shy and reluctant to speak in front of the class. Now he is always first to raise his hand to answer questions or present his work to his classmates.” </p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>For Aoba, who is thirteen and joined the school’s Year 8, everything is dialed up another notch. There are many specialist teachers and classes are conducted in small groups, streamed by capabilities. We really like the small class size here, Aoba made friends quickly, from all backgrounds; Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia etc.  </p><p></p><p>                  </p><p></p><p>In contrast to their previous international school experience, the class teachers are stricter. For Aoba, her class teacher Mr. Parr always encourages Aoba to set an example for the rest of the school. We felt Aoba began to take real ownership of her learning here, and we saw the school working as a team to help Aoba discover, and reach her potential, without going beyond the limit. The teachers here really understand our children, and motivate them to bridge the gap between their current capabilities, and their potential. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Mr. Parr, class teacher to Aoba: “When she joined us in August 2021, she appeared to be a quiet girl who struggled to speak up and express herself. The transformation she has made over the last year has been wonderful to see, as she has grown and grown in confidence in herself and her own abilities. She is now a leading voice in every class discussion, offering insightful inputs one second, and a helping hand to lower ability pupils the next."" </p><p></p><p>                   </p><p></p><p>Due to moving between countries, they find some academic subjects a slight stretch (e.g. Maths), however, our children tell us they really like studying at WASHK, especially for language, art and drama subjects. WASHK helped anchored our children into Hong Kong, thanks to the full school day and extensive after school activities. In summary, the school took our children’s education responsibilities off our shoulders. </p><p></p><p></p><p>One day we will return to Japan, and our kids will need to adapt again. We feel WASHK is preparing them well for wherever they go. In fact, Mr. Tuckett has been very helpful from day one in advising us where Aoba should go next. We are very happy she will be heading to another international school in Hong Kong, where the school and classes are bigger. We believe Aoba is ready to step into the bigger arena this September, and we credit WASHK for helping her prepare herself. </p><p>   </p><p>We will definitely recommend WASHK to any friends moving to Hong Kong, especially for younger children, as they will benefit from many years here. </p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Takano/WASHK-ceremony-272.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Takano/IMG_8661.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Takano/10852870212866.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Takano/Wakaba%203.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Takano/image-20220617-024649-f338b779.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Takano/IMG_0420.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Takano/Aoba%204.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Takano/Aoba%201.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Takano/WASHK-ceremony-146.jpg"">"
Year 6 & Year 8 Graduation Ceremony,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/2129/Year-6-&-Year-8-Graduation-Ceremony,"<p>  Despite the whole school suddenly switching to remote learning during the week, due to a surge in COVID cases, our Headmaster, Mr. Howard Tuckett, insisted that the Year 6 & Year 8 graduation proceed, because it forms such a critical element of a child’s overall development. “A good closure to a learning stage is as important as having a good start of a new chapter”, said Mr. Tuckett.</p><p></p><p>So, when the sun was setting on a Tuesday evening, our graduating students, dressed smartly in their school uniform, arrived together with their parents. Socially distanced greetings were exchanged, whilst many queued up for one final family photo before entering the hall.</p><p>        </p><p></p><p>Mr. Parr, Head of Key Stage 3 and Class Teacher to Year 8 (who came to WASHK from WASCZ), kicked off the ceremony with his typically stern face and a hint of humour. A quick welcome for the parents was immediately followed by five minutes of addressing students. A true teacher from the heart, Mr. Parr was giving his students a final lesson! This time, a lesson of self-reflection.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>“Remember at the beginning of the year, when I asked all of you to know your place at this school, that being the most senior cohort at school, your every word said, and actions performed, sets the standard for our school, and also an example for all other students to follow? I am proud to say that you have all duly carried out this responsibility well and set a fine example as the first batch of graduating students from Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong.”</p><p> </p><p></p><p>After the address, it was time for Year 6 to get onto the stage and perform their English song “Seasons of Love”. For the first time, they sang together (a week of remote learning meant there were no opportunities to rehearse). Joe Kedwards sang at top of his voice during his solo performance and parents snapped as many photos and video footage as possible. Afterall, this was the last time they were all to be on the same stage.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>Our Headmaster, Mr. Howard Tuckett, then took over and began to recall a unique year of running the school under constant disruption from COVID-19. He praised students, staff and parents in maintaining a positive attitude throughout the long periods of lockdown and explained it was the togetherness that kept the school going, and students will only emerge from this experience stronger.</p><p> </p><p>He summarized how WASHK’s core mission was to always teach their children three skills; to think, to reason, and to solve problems. These universal skills, in his mind, will remain strong and valuable to students within society, no matter what the future holds. He reminded students to embrace the unknown, to bravely walk the advancement of humanity into unchartered grounds, where it is likely their adult lives will look like something from a science fiction movie of today. </p><p></p><p>Anyone who thought Mr. Tuckett was exaggerating was soon reminded that when he was a child, he watched the first series of Star Trek on a black and white TV. He recalled people were able to talk to each other through a small mobile device- they could even see each other on different screens, and that glass doors would automatically slide open. Back then, it was all science fiction, but now look around us! Armed with the ability to think, reason, and work collaboratively to solve problems, our students are not only well-equipped to adapt to the future but help shape it as well.</p><p>                                              </p><p></p><p>Prizes, awards and souvenirs were handed out next. As each student walked onto the stage, their class teacher read a short paragraph to highlight his/her personality, interests and key achievements of the year. Every speech was unique, why? Because every child is unique. Many parents could not help but whisper to one another, “I can’t believe how well these teachers know my child!”</p><p>    Onto the Year 8 performance, and once again it was the first and last time for them to sing together “再见我的朋友，未来可期” (So long for now my friends). Despite the lack of practice, it was important that everyone took part. WASHK’s stage is not built for only those who are ‘show ready’, but for every student. In Mr. Tuckett’s words, “the objective of this song was not to impress the adults, your parents already love you no matter what. This performance was more to let you show yourself and everyone that you can do it, and with confidence as well! And for that, we applaud you.”</p><p> </p><p></p><p>Finally, it was time for students to collect their annual keepsake, the school yearbook. A tangible record of a successful year at WASHK. In the coming weeks, students will gather in their own capacity and exchange farewell messages, before they embark onto their next chapter of life. </p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/WASHK-ceremony-002.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/WASHK-ceremony-003.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/WASHK-ceremony-065%20-%20Copy.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/WASHK-ceremony-087.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/WASHK-ceremony-096.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/WASHK-ceremony-119.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/Picture2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/WASHK-ceremony-140.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/WASHK-ceremony-174.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/WASHK-ceremony-191.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/Graduation/WASHK-ceremony-258.jpg"">"
"Combining fun and passion for learning, whilst achieving excellent academic results    ","https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/2131/Combining-fun-and-passion-for-learning,-whilst-achieving-excellent-academic-results-","<p>  Zi Tong joined WASHK as a Y7 student, together with younger brother, Zi Ang, in Y3. The siblings were previously studying at another school in Hong Kong, where their parents felt the children reached a stage for change. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Zi Tong & Zi Ang’s parents: </p><p>The previous school was very caring, and nurtured our children from a young age. It operated a very child centric curriculum, and since we have plans to send our children to the UK for boarding eventually, we felt it was time for them to switch to a UK curriculum school, where they would receive a more structured and disciplined education. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>One of our relatives told us that Wycombe Abbey School had just recently opened in Hong Kong, we were curious, because we all know how great Wycombe Abbey School is in the UK, so we went for a visit to see if their sister school in Hong Kong was up to the same standard. The tour did not disappoint, and as a bonus it is a Co-Ed (we want our children to be attend the same school together until they are older). As a result, we decided to apply for both our children.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>The assessment was smooth, and more importantly, stress free. WASHK did not require us to submit a “portfolio” for our children, and even informed us a meeting with parents was optional. We were both relieved and slightly concerned at the same time, we had some doubts on whether WASHK could really live up to its academically rigorous heritage, it felt so different from other academically renowned schools in Hong Kong. Nonetheless we felt it was the right move to make, and our children joined August 2020. The rest is history. </p><p>                         </p><p></p><p>Zi Tong and Zi Ang were both excited about the fresh change, they liked their new teachers, and quite a few of them there were. Unlike their previous school, WASHK has 14 mandatory subjects taught by both class teachers, as well as specialist teachers. For Zi Ang that meant he was taught by nine teachers, and for Zi Tong, eleven! They were exposed to dozens of new opportunities and areas for discovery from day one, it was an eye-opening experience.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>One day Zi Tong came home and said “It is inspiring to study at WASHK”. We knew exactly what she meant because soon after joining, we saw her discovering a lot of interest in learning that we believe she would not have discovered elsewhere. For example, Zi Tong likes iSTEAM, especially the coding part. She also enjoyed drawing and has done very well in Drama. To summarise, WASHK brought out a lot of latent interests in our children, the school helped Zi Tong discover her potential. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>Mr. Haslam, Zi Tong’s class teacher last year: “In my teaching I aim to give students ownership of their study choices as part of their self-directed learning. Zi Tong took this opportunity to discover new interests as she dared herself to choose options she would not usually choose, and became a wiser learner because of it.” </p><p></p><p></p><p>Mr. Parr, Zi Tong’s class teacher this year: “Zi Tong also enjoys stretching her mental capabilities outside of lessons, and we’ve tried hard to accommodate that. Whatever we’ve thrown at her, whether it be extra word and number puzzles, higher ability book recommendations, or the opportunity to take part in schoolwide, local and even international academic competitions, Zi Tong has devoured it all. </p><p></p><p>I’m so pleased that Zi Tong will be staying within the Wycombe Abbey School family this year, as she moves to Wycombe Abbey UK for year 9.” </p><p>                                              </p><p></p><p>For Zi Ang, the change came in a slightly less dramatic fashion, maybe because he was a few years younger, but the biggest change for Zi Ang was that here, he actually wants to go to school! The credit must once again go to his teachers, in particular his class teacher Ms. Synders. She worked with other teachers and gave lots of consistent and encouraging words to Zi Ang, and guided him to find the love for learning here.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>Ms. Synders on Zi Ang: “Zi Ang is a very capable student who is passionate about all things Greek, since arriving into my class he has formed meaningful relationship with others and enjoys working with others” </p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>The school gives out “star of the week” certificates to students regularly, praising students for some outstanding results during the week. One time, Zi Ang came home proudly holding a “star improver” of the week certificate and told us how happy he was. This simple yet effective method propelled Zi Ang forward, it really turned his attitude towards school around. </p><p></p><p></p><p>We mentioned our initial doubt towards the academic standards at WASHK, especially after seeing so many friendly staff on campus. Having seen the work our children bring home from school, we knew this was an academically challenging school, but it is a school that succeeds in combining fun, passion in learning with academic rigour. In other words, a really balanced pedagogy. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>The defining moment for Zi Tong was when she decided to take part in the “Who Inspires You? The Wycombe Abbey 125 Essay Competition” earlier this year. This is a Four Wycombe Abbey Schools competition with hundreds of entries, including Wycombe Abbey UK. Zi Tong came 3rd overall, we were really happy that Zi Tong achieved this result, but in a way even happier that she had the confidence, and dedication to go through this competition in the first place. We don’t think she could have produced such a piece of work without the structured and disciplined academic framework at WASHK.  </p><p>                                     </p><p></p><p>We noticed Zi Ang also started to improve in his writing skills. Last year, with the encouragement of his class teacher Mrs. Harrison, he managed to write a poem about the book “Ironman” which he read. It was definitely the most impressive piece of writing we have seen coming from our seven-year-old! </p><p>                                      </p><p></p><p>Both of our children have completed two wonderful years at WASHK, and they will both be going to boarding schools in the UK; Wycombe Abbey for Zi Tong and Brockhurst for Zi Ang. Throughout the application process, the Headmaster really went out of his way and gave us valuable advice that ensured the children were well prepared for the entrance exams. His experience helped steer our family through the application journey, and his in-depth knowledge about the UK education system helped smoothen any bumps along the way. It was really heartwarming and we are grateful for Mr. Tuckett’s care on our children. </p><p></p><p></p><p>We would definitely recommend other families to join WASHK without any reservations.  </p>","<img src=""ps://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Zi%20Ang%20Zi%20Tong/image1.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Zi%20Ang%20Zi%20Tong/image2.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Zi%20Ang%20Zi%20Tong/image21.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Zi%20Ang%20Zi%20Tong/WASHK-ceremony-127.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Zi%20Ang%20Zi%20Tong/WASHK-ceremony-001.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Zi%20Ang%20Zi%20Tong/Screenshot_4.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Zi%20Ang%20Zi%20Tong/image-20220616-061203-c8ffd6bc.jpeg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Zi%20Ang%20Zi%20Tong/Screenshot_5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/Zi%20Ang%20Zi%20Tong/Screenshot_1.jpg"">"

This year, our students continued experimenting different ideas, materials and tools through team projects and individual projects. They got to learn and get inspired by different artists from different era around the world such as Alberto Giacometti, Julian Opie, Romero Britto. This year, they also celebrated Women’s history month, students learned about Mary Blaire, Louise Bourgeois, Yayoi Kusama and other famous female artists who made huge impacts in the art world. We learned to value the message of TOGETHER, WE ARE BETTER.</p><p></p><p>Click here to view the Art Exhibition at Wycombe Abbey Hong Kong</p><p></p><p>You can also view the artwork of all the other schools at Wycombe Abbey.

While it is a very exciting and happy time, it can also be daunting for both the child and their family.

WASHK Teacher Emily Harrison: A Journey into Teaching,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/2141/WASHK-Teacher-Emily-Harrison:-A-Journey-into-Teaching,"<p>Emily Harrison was part of the start up team at Wycombe Abbey Hong Kong from when it opened in 2019. She came to Hong Kong after teaching for 4 years at Daneshill Prep School in Hampshire and has a good knowledge of the British curriculum and private school sector.</p><p></p><p>Emily is a Year Three Teacher and Head of Key Stage Two. Having been to boarding school for 7 years, Emily also acts as a pastoral mentor for children who intend to board in the future. With degrees in Architecture and a PGCE, Emily has a creative yet pragmatic approach to teaching and leading the Key Stage at Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong.</p><p>    With an undergraduate degree and Masters in Architecture, I must admit that being a Primary School teacher was not the career that I had initially planned for myself, but my goodness, I am glad that I found it.</p><p></p><p>With an academic and art scholarship to an all girls’ boarding school in England, I thrived with the range of subjects, curriculum and extra-curricular activities offered. I grasped each opportunity and I have to admit, I was someone who absolutely loved school: the work, the social aspects, the sport, the art, the music, everything; and I worked hard to succeed as best I could, in all aspects of school life.</p><p>  With a love of Science, Maths and Art, a career in Architecture or Engineering was inevitably on the cards. Seven years of studying and working in Architecture, both large scale public sector buildings and smaller residential was exciting but I came to realise in my heart, that it was not for me long term.</p><p></p><p>Teaching and volunteering in Kenya and Tanzania during my university Summer holidays provided me with initial skills to deliver lessons and inspire a love of learning. Not only was it completely humbling to be teaching children who came to school full of appreciation and aspiration, it also gave me the awareness of how to teach with little to no resources and the realisation that education is the key to every child’s future.</p><p>  I still believe it was these teaching experiences in East Africa combined with ‘thinking time’ during a trek up Kilimanjaro that inspired my move into teaching.</p><p></p><p>Whether I should have pursued a teaching career from the get-go, or whether I should have continued as an architect is open to debate; but what I do know is, that I absolutely love the career that I have landed in, and, without my stint as an architect, I would not be the teacher I am today. I certainly wouldn’t have the confidence, the organisation skills or indeed the creative instincts to inspire children or instil a love of learning.</p><p>  Diving into a teaching role at a Prep School in Hampshire, England, it was then that I appreciated how much I missed being in an education environment and how glad I was to take the leap into teaching. The buzz and enthusiasm of the school and the reminder that each day, hour and minute was different to the next was what I had missed. </p><p></p><p>The routine of a daily timetable met the diversity of teaching a broad curriculum and working with such a range of children was fulfilling and I knew I had found a job that would make me incredibly happy.</p><p></p><p>I completed my PGCE whilst working at the Prep School and this, as well as working alongside inspirational colleagues taught me so much in developing and progressing as a teacher. After 4 years teaching in Hampshire, my next challenge was around the corner: living and working aboard with my husband, an adventure we both wanted.</p><p>  Working at Wycombe Abbey Hong Kong has been a marvellous opportunity, and provided me with a supportive environment where I can progress as a teacher and experience different cultures.</p><p></p><p>Although I have experience teaching across Key Stages, my passion is working in Key Stage Two, the children are inquisitive, adventurous, witty, yet continue to respond to encouragement and praise. I am increasingly passionate about engaging every type of learner, and helping children find the confidence to be able to express themselves and leave lasting impacts on their learning attitudes beyond the classroom.</p><p>  My aim will always be to instil a love of learning in every child through developing curious minds, self-belief, emotional resilience and the ability to communicate and learn effectively. </p><p></p><p>My style of teaching and now leading Key Stage Two is based on research, experience and intuition. I strongly believe that Key Stage Two is a pivotal point in a child’s education where they develop their own learning style, and begin to rely on their academic instinct.</p><p></p><p>During this age, it is so important that children know how to deal with challenges, failure, and how to persevere with an open mind-set whilst remembering that kindness is always key. </p><p>  What an honour it is to be inspiring the next generation!</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220315%20Emily%20Harrison/3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220315%20Emily%20Harrison/4.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220315%20Emily%20Harrison/5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220315%20Emily%20Harrison/6.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220315%20Emily%20Harrison/7.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220315%20Emily%20Harrison/8.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220315%20Emily%20Harrison/9.jpg"">"
Taking Responsibility in Key Stage 3 at WASHK  ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/2143/Taking-Responsibility-in-Key-Stage-3-at-WASHK,"<p>I’ve been an English teacher for 11 years, and have taught pupils from all over the world, from London to Bogota to Moscow. Teaching is my passion, and I have enjoyed every second of every lesson throughout that time. Nothing in life brings me more pleasure than seeing my pupils throw themselves into a new topic, or seeing the spark of understanding ignite as one of my pupils masters a tricky concept or new technique.</p><p></p><p>After spending 4 years as the Head of Intensive English and Head of Years 7&8 at our sister-school in Wycombe Abbey Changzhou, I moved to WASHK in August 2021 to open up Key Stage 3 as we expand into secondary education. I’m very proud to be a member of the WASHK community. </p><p>    Andrew Parr</p><p>Head of Key Stage 3</p><p>Year 8 Form Tutor</p><p>  It is a pleasure every day to be surrounded by wonderful and dedicated teachers, to work with our fantastic Key Stage 3 team, and most all to be able to play a part in helping our outstanding pupils reach their full potential.</p><p>For me, education is about so much more than just learning facts and figures. Education means helping children to develop into the best, most well-rounded version of themselves that they can become. One of the key facets of this is learning to take responsibility for yourself and those around you.</p><p>  This is hugely important for all children of course, but especially for our Key Stage 3 pupils at WASHK, many of whom will shortly be taking the enormous step of moving by themselves to another country as they take up offers at some of the best boarding schools in the UK and beyond.</p><p></p><p>I am a firm believer that the best way to have children take responsibility for themselves and their actions, is to give them responsibility.</p><p> </p><p>  Andrew Parr explaining to parents </p><p>ECA for UK School applications</p><p>  That’s why I have made it one of my goals for Key Stage 3 to create as many opportunities as possible for our pupils to take responsibility into their own hands, whether it be for themselves, their classmates, the school community or even their role in the world as a whole.</p><p>  Responsibility around School</p><p> One of the key ways we have done this is by creating positions of responsibility for our pupils. This year we introduced Key Stage 3 Class Prefects. These pupils, chosen by their peers and teachers, take charge of several important tasks. Day to day, they assist with keeping an eye on behaviour in their classes, reminding pupils of the importance of neat uniform and speaking English. At the end of lunch break it is their job to make sure all pupils are lined up and ready to return to class.</p><p> </p><p>They also act as a liaison between the pupils and teachers, making sure the pupils have a voice in several aspects of school life. Beyond that, they have also done a fantastic job helping out with school events, notably acting as ushers during our Autumn Parent-Teacher Conference. Thanks to their work, the whole event ran very smoothly, with parents greeted at the entrance and shown to where they needed to go. </p><p>  It’s not easy to hold a position of authority at a young age, but I’ve been delighted with the way that all of our prefects have stepped up to the task. They have taken their positions extremely seriously, and shown great fairness, vigilance and leadership in everything they have done – skills which I’m sure they’ll call on time and time again throughout their lives.</p><p>    Best of all, they have done it with a smile on their faces. As a Year 6 Prefect Sophie told me, ‘I enjoyed helping out in the school community, like taking people to the right classrooms on parent teacher conferences. I felt needed and important. I’ve always wanted to be the best person I could be. Being prefect helped me achieve that.’</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220315%20Andy%20Parr/1.1.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220315%20Andy%20Parr/2.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220315%20Andy%20Parr/3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220315%20Andy%20Parr/4.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220315%20Andy%20Parr/5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220315%20Andy%20Parr/6.jpg"">"
Helen Benaglia-Wood: Prepare for Transition from KG to Year 1 ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/2145/Helen-Benaglia-Wood:-Prepare-for-Transition-from-KG-to-Year-1,"<p>My name is Mrs. Helen Benaglia-Wood and I relocated to Hong Kong from the UK almost 13 years ago after completing my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics with Modern Language (Japanese). </p><p></p><p>I have worked in both international and local primary schools and kindergartens during my time here, before being part of the start-up teaching team at Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong (WASHK). </p><p>    I currently serve as the Head of Key Stage One, Year One Class Teacher and Parent Representative Coordinator. </p><p></p><p>Lifelong learning is a key value of mine: I completed my Master’s in Education Leadership with distinction last year and I obtained my Postgraduate Diploma in Education seven years ago, both whilst working full-time. </p><p>    I have also previously taught the flute to both children and adults. In my free time, I enjoy running, hiking, surf ski and I am a member of a dragon boat and outrigger canoe team in Hong Kong. I am also an avid language learner speaking Cantonese, Japanese and trying to learn Mandarin and Italian.</p><p>   </p><p>___________________________________________________________________________</p><p>  What kind of difficulties do students often encounter when they graduate from kindergarten and become a Year One student? </p><p>  The transition from kindergarten to Year One comes with challenges, all of which the children overcome amazingly well within the first month of school.</p><p></p><p>Every child’s transition differs due to their previous educational experience; some children have hardly ever spoken English; most children attended half day Kindergarten and some children have never been to school before.</p><p>    Based on my experience, these are the three key challenges that I observe most frequently.</p><p></p><p>For those children graduating from local kindergartens or those new to learning English, adapting to learning iSTEAM, Art, Music, and the variety of subjects offered at WASHK, in English, rather than in Chinese, can be a challenge. </p><p></p><p>Although most children have the language skills they need, this can certainly be a daunting transition for our non-native English speakers.</p><p>    Secondly, the adjustment from half day school to full day school can feel like a long time apart from caregivers for the children. This can be further increased if the child enrolls in the extra-curricular program offered. </p><p></p><p>Whilst having lunch at school may seem normal for adults, having lunch away from their family is a huge milestone for children.</p><p>    Some children entering Year One have never been to kindergarten before. This scenario has become increasingly popular due to multiple school closures over the last two years. This leads to children feeling that they are behind their classmates academically.</p><p></p><p>Parents question whether they should catch-up at home, whether their child is weak or underperforming. All these attitudes can cause stress and anxiety to families, and we want to avoid this. Rest assured, every child will learn effectively, at a level that is suitable for each child’s ability, once they start their learning journey at our school.</p><p>   </p><p>How could the parents better prepare the children for the transition from Kindergarten to Year One? </p><p>  To better prepare children for starting Year One, I would recommend three areas to develop: </p><p></p><p>language, routine and independence. </p><p></p><p>For those new to speaking English, I usually suggest that parents can spend a certain time during the day, for example, before dinner, to speak English. </p><p></p><p>This could be for just 15 minutes at first and then increasing the time frame as the children become more comfortable. Doing this will expose children to English conversational language, especially the vocabulary used for giving instructions. If the parents also have limited English, please refrain from being shy, this is a fantastic time to learn a few sentences together!</p><p>    Secondly, routine and structure are highly important for young children. Waking up and going to bed at the same time and ensuring adequate rest is the key to preparing a child. This routine can begin much earlier than when school starts, even in the first few years of a child’s life. </p><p></p><p>Routine should be kept throughout the holidays too, especially during the long summer break before their first day in ‘big school’. Allowing time to exercise, get fresh air and relax are equally important within their busy school routine.</p><p>    Finally, independence. Children can help at home to do small tasks: set the table, tidy their toys, put their clothes away, to name a few. These activities give children ownership and make them realise what they are capable of. </p><p>  Once starting school, children should pack their own school bag every evening before bed (you don’t go out without knowing what is in your bag, so why should they!</p><p>  When children pack their bag, they know what to expect the following day, the different books or letters the teacher may need, their homework and what they will be eating at snack time. This simple action encourages independence and sets the child up for the school day ahead.</p><p>    How does WASHK prepare children for this transition process and support the children to be ready for their primary school life?</p><p>  Before a child enters WASHK, they are assessed. The purpose of the assessment is to see whether he/she is suitable to join Year One as well as confirming that WASHK is the right school for that child. We are assessing a child’s potential not what they know during the assessment, so that teachers can prepare for each family’s arrival to WASHK. </p><p>  The teachers at WASHK support children from before their first day at our school. From the assessment, parents will be made aware of any fundamental areas to improve, so that they can work on this before they enter the school.</p><p>  On the first day of school, the children are guided through the classroom, where to put their school bags are where the washrooms are.</p><p>  A visual timetable is used so that children know what is coming next throughout their school day. Although children are happy at school, they want to know when they expect to go home to see their caregivers again.</p><p>  Whilst we want children to be independent, in unpacking their bag and getting out their correct learning materials, we are there to guide them through every step of the journey.</p><p>  WASHK is the most flexible and student focused school I have ever worked in. Whether it be learning online or face-to-face learning, the teachers provide outstanding support to our families.</p><p>  This could be through differentiated learning materials, phone calls to the families or one-on-one intervention. Individual targets, goals and support are put in place, so that regardless of a child’s needs, they are presented with best environment to excel. For example, if a child is new to learning English, specialist support and additional sessions will be scheduled.</p><p>  Every teacher is dedicated and committed to provide the best learning experience for all children in the Wycombe Abbey School community, not only during the transition to primary school but throughout their whole educational journey.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/1.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/4.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/6.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/7.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/8.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/9.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/10.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/11.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220322%20Helen%20Wood/12.png"">"

WASHK Headmaster: Discover True Potential of Children,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/2149/WASHK-Headmaster:-Discover-True-Potential-of-Children,"<p>It is a widely discussed truism that children are all different from each other, just as adults are. A torsion often arises as modern education systems strive to release individuality in each child, whilst working in a system that is designed for a mass, results-focused education.</p><p></p><p>Nonetheless, a well-designed and sensitively managed school can go a long way to assisting parents and each child themselves discover where their individual strengths and talents lie.</p><p>  Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong</p><p>  Every school that is doing its job well will have a very good idea of a child’s academic potential and capabilities, measured using accurate but narrowly defined tools such as verbal and non-verbal reasoning, reading ages and the like. </p><p></p><p>None of these very useful tools though tell us anything about the wider capabilities or anything about a child’s character, resilience, or skills beyond the scope of narrow academic abilities.</p><p>  Probably the tallest (15 metres) indoor climbing wall </p><p>in Hong Kong</p><p>    Identifying broader potential is a much more unwieldy exercise and cannot be achieved by using neat assessment packages, available by purchasing an online license.</p><p></p><p>At any school where I have had a decision-making role, I have done my best to offer a breadth of experiences for our pupils. </p><p>    The most mundane of subjects can replicate real-working-life experience with some imaginative lesson planning.</p><p></p><p>By incorporating life skills such as problem solving, collaborative learning, trying to persuade others and, presenting to an audience pupils can find out that they have a skill in empathy, in encouragement, in clear thinking, in brainstorming, in making people laugh, in asking the right question at the right time, in keeping the rest of the group on-task and so on. </p><p></p><p>These are all skills that will become talents in the workplace in a few short years. Great schools will evidence lessons in all kinds of mainstream subjects where pupils are exposed to trying out all the critical professional skills.</p><p>  Thus, education is a social business. Life in the workplace and life in schools is all about getting on with people. Making teams work. Taking an idea and making it better together. None of these things can be done in isolation. </p><p></p><p>No matter how clever the technology, on-line learning is a poor substitute for class-based teaching. You need to interact with people to learn and to achieve progress.</p><p>  Discovering potential can be likened to princesses kissing frogs. You need to keep on, and on, and on trying new things, until you find the one that is yours.</p><p></p><p>As a child, it turned out I was not very good at catching a ball or running quickly. I was told I was not sporty and spent my school years getting in the way in the ‘D’ team games. </p><p></p><p>When I left school, I was given the opportunity to learn to shoot a rifle and became very good. I subsequently competed at a high level. I became a keen canoeist, (I am still paddling in my sixties), I also became a very capable horseman. </p><p></p><p>My school did not offer shooting, riding or canoeing, so nobody knew I had these capabilities at the time – least of all me.</p><p>  The point is that I had some very real potential but as a pupil I was not in an environment where these capabilities could come to light. In my case this is to be expected. Very few schools have safe facilities for teaching target shooting or equestrian centers. </p><p></p><p>The lesson has been learned though.  At Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong we have put as much effort and as many resources as possible to providing a width of experiences in our extra-curricular activities programme. </p><p></p><p>Every day, normal lesson time is extended by a further two hours, until 5.00pm, as children join over fifty different clubs and activities.</p><p>  It is my absolute ambition that for each child during their time at Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong that they, (and we), will discover what their gifts are. </p><p></p><p>As teachers our role is to help our pupils find the gifts they have been given and to assist our children to carefully unwrap them so that they are ready to be taken forward into each individual’s emerging adult life.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220406%20Howard/3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220406%20Howard/4.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220406%20Howard/5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220406%20Howard/6.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220406%20Howard/7.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220406%20Howard/8.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220406%20Howard/9.png"">"

Big Bang Academy is an accredited science EdTech start-up founded in 2020. They started with a small workshop of 15 students and a dream. Since then, Big Bang has grown to more than 3,000 students, both in the classroom and on their own online education platform, Big Bang Lab. </p><p></p><p>Big Bang's mission is to make learning as engaging as a movie, as fun as a theme park and as educational as a classroom.</p><p></p><p>Campers can immerse themselves in the world of science and engage with a range of exciting science topics, not found in the classroom. Campers can also participate in group work that builds their confidence and sparks their curiosity.</p><p>Big Bang Academy's summer camp runs two sessions (morning and afternoon) from Monday to Friday, for children aged 6 to 9. </p><p></p><p>Each week the theme of the camp changes, from ""Galactic Conquest"" to ""Eco Explorer"" and ""Chemistry Wizard Academy"". The children are guided by highly qualified and friendly leaders to become active themselves within an ‘iSTEAM’ environment. The summer camp runs until 29 July.</p><p>  AI Farming Summer Programme</p><p>In the second week of July, WASHK partnered with Consilium Education to host the third summer camp launching an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Farming Summer Programme. </p><p></p><p>It is a bespoke two-day AI farming programme that runs until 31 July. With ICT Award-winning technology, children can learn about Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and how to use cutting-edge technology to solve the future global food crisis, and experience growing food in the classroom.</p><p>Many of the camp activities are new to many of the campers. When children are encouraged to try new things and push their personal boundaries, they learn to overcome challenges as they become more confident and aware of their potential for success.</p><p></p><p>It is very important that children stay active and engaged during the school holidays. Not only do they have the opportunity to push their limits and try new activities, but summer camps also give children the chance to meet new people and make new friends, as many activities are about solving problems through good communication and teamwork.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220802%20Summer%20Camp/1.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220802%20Summer%20Camp/2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220802%20Summer%20Camp/3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220802%20Summer%20Camp/4.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220802%20Summer%20Camp/5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220802%20Summer%20Camp/6.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/20220802%20Summer%20Camp/7.jpg"">"

WASHK Headmaster：Child Emotional Health and Wellbeing Webinar,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3153/WASHK-Headmaster%EF%BC%9AChild-Emotional-Health-and-Wellbeing-Webinar,"<p>On Thursday 28 April we were delighted to host an online seminar on the topic of child wellbeing and our pupils’ mental health. </p><p>  The online seminar took the form of a panel discussion. I am a great supporter of this format as it involves so many more talented people and is far more likely to bring a key insight to members of our audience from the breadth of the members of the panel.</p><p></p><p>For this online seminar I was joined by Fred Zhang, one of our Chinese Language teachers, Jasmine Vincent, a Year 2 class teacher and Matthew Haslam, one of our Year 6 class teachers.</p><p>WASHK Headmaster</p><p>Howard Tuckett</p><p>We started off by describing for the audience what we mean by a child’s wellbeing and what the relationship is between a child’s academic success and their mental health.</p><p></p><p>We then moved on and looked at a few points that have become very pertinent from lockdowns in Hong Kong. We looked at what the emotional and wellbeing impact has been on children who have spent considerable periods of time away from school and normal social interaction, as they have spent so long confined in their own homes, often without adequate facilities for regular or prolonged exercise in their average day. </p><p></p><p>We were also able to give parents some pointers, signs, to look out for that may suggest incidents of mental health impact for children, as opposed to normal levels of moodiness and withdrawal which are a part of any child’s behaviour.</p><p>Year 2 class teacher</p><p>Jasmine Vincent</p><p>Moving on, we considered child wellbeing and mental health in a normal school situation, without the impact of Covid. We described how a school like ours teaches holistically, meaning we look after the development of the whole child. We described the extraordinarily complex and active systems of monitoring and communication that our school has for keeping track of each child’s wellbeing and mental health.</p><p></p><p>Parents were pleasantly surprised to learn how proactively schools such as our monitor, continuously consult and keep detailed records of pupil mental wellbeing issues. Again, we came back to how parents can monitor their child’s mental and emotional wellbeing and how important collaboration with the school is in this regard.</p><p>Year 6 class teacher</p><p>Matthew Haslam</p><p>One of the recurrent themes in any discussion on child wellbeing is the role and impact of technology and social media. I am aware that we could devote an entire online seminar to this topic. We referred to the impact of social media at several points. </p><p></p><p>The recurring theme was how children who have access to phones and tablets throughout the day and at night never get a break from social interaction with their peers, which can lead to social and emotional exhaustion, which in turn, negatively impacts wellbeing and mental health.</p><p></p><p>We also discussed how critical it is to support and ensure a child’s mental and emotional wellbeing during the primary phase, to support children in their wellbeing during the more turbulent teenage years.</p><p>Chinese Language teacher</p><p>Fred Zhang</p><p>We completed the online seminar by taking some questions from the audience via our chat room. Like all such webinars, we soon ran out of time. Hopefully, we will be able to offer another event in order to continue this important discussion at another time.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220510%20Webinar/1.2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220510%20Webinar/2.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220510%20Webinar/3.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220510%20Webinar/4.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220510%20Webinar/5.png"">"

"WASHK Teacher Nicola Rae: Drama, preparing pupils for real world","https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3157/WASHK-Teacher-Nicola-Rae%EF%BC%9ADrama,-preparing-pupils-for-real-world","<p>Nicola Rae was appointed our first Head of Drama in February 2020. She came to Hong Kong in 2006 to teach English through Drama upon graduating with a BA (Hons) degree in Drama, Applied Theatre and Education from the renowned Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London, England.</p> <p>Whilst in Hong Kong, Nicola has taught at both local and DSS primary and secondary schools as well as a through-train international school before coming to Wycombe Abbey. Besides this, she also set up her own charitable arts organisation to create more drama opportunities for people who have English as a Second Language. </p><p>Nicola has worked with professional local arts organisations including the Hong Kong Youth Arts Foundation and Sweet and Sour Productions in many capacities including as an actress and dancer. Whilst in Hong Kong, Nicola also gained a Post Graduate degree in Theatre and Entertainment Arts from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts; an MA in Education from the University of Sunderland and a TESOL certificate from TEFL International. </p><p>Nicola is currently in the final stages of completing her training to become a Trinity Speech and Drama examiner too. With over 15 years teaching experience, she brings many skills and ideas with her to the post of Head of Speech and Drama at Wycombe Abbey. </p><p>How did you fall in love with Drama when you were a student? In your opinion, if a child would like to learn Drama very well, what kind of qualities or skills do they often have in common? </p><p>If you asked me when I was 12 years old, if being in the world of Drama in the future was a possibility, I would have thought it was an impossible suggestion. I was a very timid child who struggled with speaking in public and I had very little confidence as a student. At the age of 13, my parents recognised that I needed to build my confidence, so they enrolled me in my local school Drama group. Thanks to some amazing teachers who believed in me more than I believed in myself, I grew in confidence and fell in love with Drama.</p><p>I think anyone who is willing to take risks can learn Drama. You don’t have to be an amazing actor or the best creative thinker but to be able to take risks, however small, just to try something new and to be willing to build your confidence step by step will enable you to experience all the skills Drama has to offer. Seeing students who remind me of me when I was younger make me a big advocate for Drama in education. I know how powerful it can be and how it can change lives for the better. The life skills you accumulate and practice through studying Drama are essential for any future self.</p><p>How would you define the significance of Drama Education in children's growth and why? </p><p>Students now are training for jobs that haven’t been invented yet. The skills that you experience and acquire in Drama will help prepare you for a future that is yet to be created. Through Drama we can develop skills such as confidence, communication, teamwork, leadership, creativity, flexibility, trust, negotiation, empathy, lateral thinking and problem solving. These are essential skills in any profession, as well as being vital skills for being a responsible and productive member of society. Through Drama we can imagine what life will be like, act and react to scenarios and problem-solve in an imagined world. All these experiences can help prepare us for real-life. What subject is more of a replication of life than Drama?</p><p>What are the distinctive characteristics or features of WASHK Drama teaching? Could you please give us some examples? </p><p>Lessons are mainly practical and interactive as I am a firm believer in what we can experience we can remember. At WASHK we have a wide-ranging Speech and Drama curriculum tailored to help all ability levels explore, challenge and reach their full potential.</p><p>Each year level will learn about and build upon different skills as well as explore different stories. Units cover Performance Poetry; Public Speaking and Presentation Skills; Japanese Bunraku Puppetry and Chinese Opera; Author Study; Play-Text Study; Folktales and Cultural Stories; Musical and Physical Theatre; Improvisation; Devising and Playwriting. All units aim to teach students key Drama skills and vocabulary as well as enabling students to engage deeper with scenarios, characters and narratives. There are also a lot of cross curricular learning opportunites that help support students in other school subjects including English, Humanities, Art, Music, iSTEAM and P.E.</p><p>All students work towards large scale productions giving students the opportunity to apply what they have learnt, demonstrate their skills and develop their confidence and talent in performing. KS1 students work towards a performance sharing at Christmas, whilst KS2 and KS3 students work towards an end-of-year show in the summer term.  </p><p>Students will also get to develop their aesthetic appreciation and understanding through going to the theatre and taking part in specialist workshops lead by outside practitioners.</p><p>Have you ever encountered any interesting or impressive stories of a child transforming a lot after he/she participated in Drama learning?</p><p>Students at Wycombe Abbey are constantly surprising me with their willingness to take risks in my classroom. Developing a safe space where students feel supported to make mistakes is really important in my lesson. Developing trust is also vital in the Drama class. With these expectations in place, students are constantly developing their teamwork and confidence. </p><p>One student, in particular, comes to mind who showed me the transformative qualities of Drama. When I met this young girl in Year 2, she rarely spoke in class or spoke so quietly, it was really hard to hear her. Over the course of the year and taking small risks each lesson, she slowly came out of her shell and this year she was able to participate in the Hong Kong Schools Speech Festival and achieve a high score for her performance. </p><p>I know her success isn’t just down to studying Drama though. All teachers at Wycombe Abbey truly care about their students and with this support along with her own determination, she succeeded.</p><p>Many people can easily disregard Creative Arts subjects as secondary to that of more academic ones and to those people I say, believe and invest in Drama.   Drama resembles life itself, it is a great tool for preparing students for the real world. The multitude of skills that can be learnt in the drama classroom are constantly being tested and practiced so they become inherent in our nature as we grow older and venture on to new and exciting challenges. Learning Drama equips students with skills to survive in the 21st Century and it truly does help in “Building confidence for life” which is Wycombe Abbey’s commitment to all of our pupils.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220517%20Nicola/1.7.Jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220517%20Nicola/2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220517%20Nicola/3.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220517%20Nicola/4.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220517%20Nicola/5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220517%20Nicola/5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220517%20Nicola/6.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220517%20Nicola/6.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220517%20Nicola/7.jpg"">"
WASHK Teacher Evelyn Chin: Learning Arts with a growth mindset,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3159/WASHK-Teacher-Evelyn-Chin:-Learning-Arts-with-a-growth-mindset,"<p>WASHK Teacher Evelyn Chin: Learning Arts with a growth mindset</p><p>Evelyn is the Art and design teacher in WASHK. With a degree in Media and advertising from England, PGCE and visual art education certificate. She believes that a play-based and hand-on approach when teaching art allows children to become more curious about the world, independent and problem solvers. Evelyn has also been studying art therapy to help children express themselves and build confidence and trust. Besides creating arts, Evelyn also enjoys participating in musicals and promote sustainable living to her students. </p><p>Evelyn Chin - Art & Design Teacher</p><p>How did you fall in love with Art when you were a student? In your opinion, if a child would like to learn Art very well, what kind of qualities or skills do they often have in common? </p><p>Growing up, I was never the top 5 students in my class. However, I always do well in specialist subjects such as music, performing arts and arts. I have always loved Art because this is a subject that is all about creativity, problem-solving and hands-on experimenting. Art is a subject where you can apply the skills you learn to your daily life. For example, by knowing how to sew in Art, you will know how to repair clothes by yourself, by knowing how to plan and attach objects, you can build furniture or even buildings in the future.  </p><p>If a child wants to learn Arts, all you need is a growth mindset. Be a risk-taker, be open-minded, and do not worry about making mistakes because many great arts come from ""happy little accidents""- Bob Ross.  </p><p>How would you define the significance of Art Education in children's growth and why? </p><p>'Every child is an artist.' - Picasso </p><p>Since there's no right or wrong in Art, we welcome students to be different, odd, fun, and everything they want here in the art room. In a world that is so full of technology. Robots might replace most of the jobs in the future. What makes us different compared to robots? It's our mindset, creativity and compassion. </p><p>Through arts, we use our imagination to create new things. We understand that nothing is impossible if you spend enough time and effort on what you want.</p><p></p><p>In Art, we welcome mistakes and happy accidents. These mistakes and accidents are to help us learn and make us resilient. By looking at arts from different artists and different countries. We learn to understand the history and be open-minded to things that are different to us. The more we know about the world, the more we can create a peaceful world. </p><p>What are the distinctive characteristics or features of WASHK Art teaching? Could you please give us some examples? </p><p>I have been enjoying teaching in WASHK. The freedom and resources we have, I can see that it helps the children to thrive. The more tools we have, the more skills we can learn. The more resources and materials we have, the more possibilities and ideas we can explore. </p><p></p><p>And the best part about Art and design in WASHK is… we have a big garden. The children can be close to nature, and they can observe birds, insects and different seasons in WASHK. With the space we have, we can do splash arts, still life drawing and who knows… build a 2-storage high cardboard birdhouse?  </p><p>Have you ever encountered any interesting or impressive stories of a child transforming a lot after he/she participated in Art learning? </p><p>A boy from my last school joined the school halfway through the school year. He was transferred from a local school to an international school. Teachers' teaching styles are different compared to local and international schools. We could see that the child was shy and scared, and he had trouble making friends and adapting to the new school environment. In arts, I noticed that he enjoys drawing and can produce imaginative artwork. When I tried to get to know him and introduce myself to him. He would respond in 2-3 words. But whenever I asked him to explain his creation to me, he would talk and talk and talk. I took this opportunity to invite him to explain his work to the others in the class.</p><p></p><p>And since he is good at using his imagination in his creation. When we had our unit based on surrealism, he was the teacher's helper in the class, and I can see that he gained so much confidence through arts, and he also started building relationships with his classmates and trust with me.  </p><p>This is the most rewarding part of being a teacher; Meeting a child, understanding their needs, and planning your teaching around to help cater to different children and see them thrive independently.   </p><p></p><p>The world is changing every day. Education is so different compared to when we were a child.  Technology plays a big part of our teaching these days. In WASHK, we have smart TVs, iPads, 3D printers, laser cutters etc. The children get to learn something new every day in WASHK. Teachers also get to know so much and help us keep up with the world and the new generation in WASHK.   </p><p></p><p>We are also so lucky that the world we live in now cares about mental health and everyone's wellbeing. In WASHK, we have a great student support team who is always here to help and support different children. In WASHK, all children can build confidence for life. </p><p>   </p><p>←  Previous News</p><p>Inter-House Drone Quidditch at WASHK</p><p>BACK TO NEWS & BLOG</p><p>Next News  →</p><p>WASHK Teacher Nicola Rae：Drama, preparing pupils for real world</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220523%20Evelyn/1.8.Jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220523%20Evelyn/2.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220523%20Evelyn/3.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220523%20Evelyn/4.png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220523%20Evelyn/5.jpg"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/220523%20Evelyn/6.jpg"">"

At Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong, we let our imagination take flight!</p><p>Through racing drones, our pupils magically tracing their trajectories with 3D printed magic wands, inspiring aircraft flight magic and aerodynamics; competing vigorously, of course, in our four houses - Dragon, Phoenix, Lion and Gryphon.</p><p>Our quidditch involved three rounds per class (Years 1-8), in which, every house played against each other and then competed in the final round. The iSTEAM room had two lanes facing opposite, each with a course involving two hoops and a flag.</p><p>Pupils had to skillfully fly the drones using the controls in the TELLO EDU app on their iPads. The drones took-off simultaneously, navigating safely through the hoops, mitigating the flag, and landing safely on the ground within sixty seconds.</p><p></p><p>Our pupils showed true competitive spirit. They not only dressed up for the occasion in traditional Harry Potter costumes, but also fought like a Lion, breathed fire like a Dragon, rose like a Phoenix and showed the bravery of a Gryphon.</p><p></p><p>While flying the drones in their houses, our students showed unity in togetherness, supporting each other and showing grit, resilience and determination.

WASHK Admission Manager: School admission should be stress-free   ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3163/WASHK-Admission-Manager:-School-admission-should-be-stress-free,"<p>WASHK Admission Manager: School admission should be stress-free  </p><p></p><p></p><p>With the keen competition to enter top-tier primary schools in Hong Kong, trying to gain admission can be stressful and daunting for both parents and their children. Kerry Morris, Admission Manager of Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong, gave tips on school admission in her presentation, ‘Primary school admission should be stress-free for child and parents’.</p><p>  “When I first moved to Hong Kong, I was genuinely surprised by how lengthy and difficult primary school admissions are out here. Multiple interviews, costly applications, substantial preparation and required documents are just a few obstacles parents face when applying for a primary school.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, our Headmaster, Mr. Howard Tuckett, designed an admissions process at WASHK that is comprehensive, while alleviating stress for children and parents.”</p><p>The preparation process is not as overwhelming as parents think it is. There is no need to rehearse rigorously for interviews; just having more day-to-day conversations with their kids is enough.</p><p></p><p>“It would be best for children to speak in a natural and organic way in interviews; so instead of making them memorize scripts, help them get used to talking about everyday things like their hobbies and interests,” Morris advised.</p><p>  What should families look for in a ‘good’ admissions process?</p><p>  I always tell parents to start with the school. It sounds obvious but making sure the school is a right fit for their child is vital in having a successful academic career. </p><p></p><p>There is nothing wrong with a lengthy and regimented admissions process, but it’s important to understand how your child learns best and then decide if it is the right environment for them.</p><p>What can students expect from an assessment at WASHK?</p><p>  All our assessments are conducted in a friendly and welcoming environment. We do not believe in making this process a stressful or intimidating experience, as we don’t feel it is beneficial for the child, or for us as a school. We genuinely want to get to know the child, understand them as an individual and ensure that morally, it is right to offer the child a place at the school.</p><p></p><p>- Simple application and assessment process</p><p></p><p>- Play-visits for KS1</p><p></p><p>- Second interviews available</p><p></p><p>- Fast processing (answer within 7 working days)</p><p></p><p>- Minimal Preparation</p><p></p><p>- Facilitated by one person</p><p>What do you look for when assessing a child?</p><p>  The key attribute we look for when conducting our assessments is, potential. There could be many reasons a child is not fulfilling their potential academically, socially or emotionally, and we want to see if, in the right environment, we can help them grow as an individual.</p><p>  Do you help students navigate their post-primary school life?</p><p>  We have a Boarding & Secondary School Guidance Programme, where we support students and their families with their applications to the best boarding schools in the UK, USA, and secondary schools around the world, including Hong Kong. </p><p></p><p>This year our students each received multiple offers from top schools in the UK, such as Wycombe Abbey School UK, Rugby, Cheltenham Ladies College, Roedean, Badminton, Benenden and Malvern St James, to name just a few.</p><p></p><p>We have an experienced team of experts who can help prepare a child academically for the entrance exams, as well as mentally for the change post-primary school.

The start of a new school year is always something of an undertaking with so many new students, new members of staff and invariably, new structures and procedures being introduced.</p><p> </p><p>  We were very pleased with the way that our first day went. It was a delight to be able to welcome so many of our students into school, all so keen and eager to get started.</p><p>  New classes of children were happily, in their rooms and everyone was settled and working away very quickly on the first morning. </p><p></p><p>We were so impressed by how quickly our new year- groups had settled.

Since early in 2020 we have been working hard to achieve all the very exacting standards required by Microsoft to qualify. Our use and development of the Teams and OneNote technologies as the foundation of our online learning provision has been a core aspect of our success. We have also held to our ongoing commitment to staff training and development using the Microsoft Education Centre Courses. Most members of staff are Microsoft Innovative Educators, (M.I.E). Some have achieved 'Expert' status, (MIEE). WASHK continues to drive forward, committed to the focused application of technology in education. Throughout the teaching day our children use all kinds of tools and technologies to help them innovate, problem solve and work together with others to find better solutions to challenges and scenarios given to them. All of this provision is backed-up by the daily use of tablet technology in daily lessons. </p><p> </p><p>←  Previous News</p><p>More Hong Kong students are studying abroad sooner, with help of partnership between HSBC and educational institutions</p><p>BACK TO NEWS & BLOG</p><p>Next News  →</p><p>A Wonderful Start of New Academic Year at WASHK</p>",

Enriching Student Education through Giving at WASHK    ,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3173/Enriching-Student-Education-through-Giving-at-WASHK,"<p>Enriching Student Education through Giving at WASHK    </p><p></p><p></p><p>To instill a spirit of giving and to inspire students to give back to the communities they live in, Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong (WASHK) recently took part in a charity event organized by HSBC to build a limited-edition HSBC LEGO building composed of 2,400 pieces.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The charity event titled: “HSBC Building BIG Challenge – Belief, Inclusion & Generosity” aims to promote the concept of ‘giving back’ amongst young children while at the same time helping to raise awareness about mental wellbeing and childcare in the city.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Aside from the fact that WASHK and HSBC are well known brands in Hong Kong and in Britain, both organisations also share similar values. For this reason, the partnership only made sense.</p><p></p><p>  Both organisations are world leaders in their field, both strive for excellence.</p><p></p><p>Both organisations value academic ability, a high level of technical competence and value people who demonstrate creativity, social intelligence and a vibrant can-on attitude, that is why we partnered on this charity event.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As part of the event’s mission to raise awareness about Autism amongst children, for every completed building, HK$500 was donated to the Autism Partnership Foundation (APF).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Autism Partnership Foundation</p><p></p><p>Established in 2007, APF supports the development of local children with autism by carrying out special school services to meet the learning needs of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In September, the charity established a new AP school to provide tailored teaching to help develop the social skills of those children with ASD. The hope is that this would give them the confidence and ability that would enable them to go back out into mainstream society. The event is significant as it helps to raise funds for these causes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The lives of countless children diagnosed with ASD (autism spectrum disorder) can be changed forever with quality behavioural intervention, but that intervention is out of reach for too many children and their families, according to the Foundation. For this reason, events like this can help to raise the profile for the foundation, while also helping people to understand what Autism is all about and how they can help.   </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p></p><p>For the 40 students who represented WASHK to attend the event, it was also significant in that it taught these students that no matter the size of their contributions, they can also make a positive impact on society. </p><p></p><p></p><p>HSBC Main Building in Real Life</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>WASHK Student Artworks</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>At this event, our students learnt that even with their little hands, they can make a big impact on the community! </p><p></p><p>Indeed, WASHK puts great emphasis in providing students with a holistic education that addresses all areas and stages of their development beyond their academics.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>The school offers a curriculum of 14 primary subjects and more than 50 Extra Curricular Activity (ECA) choices for students with the goal to develop them as a whole child, while preparing them for their future as global citizens.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>We will not only teach them knowledge, but also the soft skills that students need for their future.</p><p></p><p>We are not able to teach them the knowledge they will need in the future as the technology they will have at their disposal then has not been invented yet. Instead, we teach them the attitude, mindset and other soft skills such as confidence, problem solving, communication, teamwork, and wellbeing that they will need in their future.</p><p></p><p>As part of that commitment, careful attention and planning goes into any extra-curricular extension experiences such as this charity event. The idea is that it would complement the students to learn more about their community and to get involved in improving their surroundings and helping those people in need.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“For WASHK, we do not ‘teach’ wellbeing in isolation, it is embedded in everything that we do,” Tuckett added.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The school is well known for walking the talk. Aside from this event, WASHK has also been active in other charitable programmes such as the “Box of Hope” campaign, which helps underprivileged children in Hong Kong through educational gift giving during the holiday seasons. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> “Box of Hope” Campaign</p><p></p><p>The school is also well known for its Eco Warrior ECA club which was formed by students to promote sustainability, recycling and green living in the school community.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Eco Warrior ECA Club</p><p></p><p></p><p>The sum of these experiences go a long way to educate students about giving back while also piquing their curiosity and interests as global citizens, the school added.</p><p></p><p>For these reasons, WASHK is excited to carry on this collaboration with APF and HSBC. Tuckett said that this would really allow the school to prepare young people of Hong Kong to be ready to become business and professional leaders of the future.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>“Enriching our core curriculum with collaborations such as these feeds into the breadth and wealth of our holistic curriculum and ultimately benefits our students in their development,” he said.</p><p></p><p>←  Previous News</p><p>WAS Changzhou Immersive Chinese Language and Sports Camp</p><p>BACK TO NEWS & BLOG</p><p>Next News  →</p><p>More Hong Kong students are studying abroad sooner, with help of partnership between HSBC and educational institutions</p>",

Drama Classes in Hong Kong (inc Phonetics & Speech),https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3193/Drama-Classes-in-Hong-Kong,"<p>In an age where screens dominate, encouraging children to engage in drama and theater can be a refreshing shift.</p><p></p><p>Learning Drama isn’t just about learning to act. Drama aids the learning of a plethora of life skills that are frequently practiced when children engage in making and experiencing Drama. Skills such as communication, teamwork, confidence building, creative thinking and leadership.</p><p></p><p>However, in saying that, many careers have an aspect of “performance” about them. Whether that’s delivering top customer service, leading a board-meeting or presenting a case to a jury, Drama, with its inherent skills, can prepare students for life beyond the classroom.</p><p></p><p>With A.I taking over many professions, creative industries are paramount to thinking outside the box, problem solving and creating new opportunities in an ever changing world.</p><p></p><p>People don’t want to read stories written by a computer or films performed by a robot. Drama provides a connection with being human. Drama teachers empathy, compassion and the understanding of different people from different worlds.</p><p></p><p>Above all, Drama is about playing. Drama is fun to learn because it is play based and skills are taught in an experiential way. This style of learning helps engage children and acquire the skills often in a non-explicit way. They become ingrained in part of the child’s nature. Children are naturally curious and creative and Drama supports those attributes that so unfortunately get lost when growing-up.</p><p></p><p>Drama classes for children in Hong Kong not only introduce them to the enchanting world of performing arts but also impart essential life skills.</p><p></p><p>If you're wondering why enrolling your child in an acting class might be a wise decision, read on!</p><p>The Rising Popularity of Drama Classes for Children</p><p>How Can Drama Education Help Children?</p><p>Why Drama and Theatre?</p><p>Drama Classes in Hong Kong (Definitive List for 2023)</p><p>Phonetics Classes are a Great Way to Build Confidence</p><p>Lessons To Help A Shy Child</p><p>Life Skills Taught by Acting Classes for Children</p><p>The Value of Drama for Children of All Ages</p><p>Benefits Beyond the Stage</p><p>Finding the Perfect Program for Your Child</p><p>Incorporating Drama in Daily Life</p><p></p><p>The Rising Popularity of Drama Classes for Children</p><p></p><p>More parents are recognizing the multifaceted benefits of drama class.

"Understanding the Academic System, Admissions Procedures, and Tuition Fees of International Schools","https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3269/International-school-academic-system,-admissions-procedures,-tuition-fees","<p>International schools are known for their competitive nature globally. Their offerings in English and multiple languages, coupled with a multicultural learning environment, increasingly attract parents. Choosing an international school for your school-age children is a crucial decision. This article aims to provide a concise overview of international schools, covering the academic system, admissions procedures, and tuition fees, to give parents a preliminary understanding.</p><h2>Academic System of International Schools:</h2> <p>International schools in Hong Kong offer various academic systems, including the British GCSE and A-Levels, the American AP and SAT, and the International Baccalaureate (IB). Each system has distinct characteristics and requirements. Parents should select the schooling system that aligns with their child's interests, abilities, and future aspirations. Generally, the British academic system is known for its rigor and specialization, the American system for its flexibility and breadth, and the IB for being well-balanced and comprehensive.</p> <h2>Admissions Procedures:</h2> <p>The admissions procedures for international schools in Hong Kong vary. Some schools require entrance exams, others request letters of recommendation and portfolios, and some conduct interviews. It's essential to understand the admissions requirements and procedures of each school well in advance and prepare your child accordingly. Typically, entrance exams evaluate a child's abilities in Chinese, mathematics, and logic; letters of recommendation and portfolios highlight the child's personality, strengths, and achievements; and interviews assess communication, cooperation, and adaptability skills.</p> <p>International schools in Hong Kong do not operate a unified admissions system. Each school has its own procedures, and parents usually need to apply directly to the schools for admission. Admissions can generally be categorized into two types: rolling enrollment and new academic year enrollment. Rolling admissions allow students to apply at any time and join classes if vacancies are available. New academic year enrollment requires students to apply from September to October of the year preceding admission and to undergo interviews or tests by the year's end, with results announced from March to April of the following year. Parents should monitor the admission information and deadlines of their preferred international schools closely to ensure they do not miss any opportunities.</p> <p>For example, at Wycombe Abbey School in Hong Kong, we evaluate each child's learning potential, including their proficiency in English, reading and writing comprehension, mathematics, problem-solving abilities, cognitive skills, and social skills.</p> <ul>     <li>- Applicants in grades 1 to 2 will be assessed in small groups on their numeracy, cognitive, interpersonal and social skills abilities. In addition, children's understanding and use of English will also be assessed. </li>     <li>- Applicants applying for grades 3 to 8 are required to take written and online assessments covering English, mathematics and logical reasoning. </li> </ul> <p>We are now open for applications for grades 1 to 8. Mid-term admissions and transfers are also provided based on quota. We are constantly reviewing all new applications and all students will receive an invitation for assessment within two weeks of submitting their application. </p> <h2>International school tuition fees</h2> <p>The tuition fees of international schools in Hong Kong are another significant factor to consider. Given that most international schools are private and do not benefit from government subsidies, their fees surpass those of local schools. Beyond the annual tuition, some international schools issue bonds or debentures for purchase by individuals or companies. This serves as a funding mechanism to support school development and enhance facilities.</p> <p>Certain schools may offer bondholders priority in admissions or in reserving slots. However, it's crucial for parents to understand that owning a bond does not guarantee admission. The terms related to pricing, transfer, refunds, and other aspects of the bond differ across schools. Therefore, parents are advised to thoroughly review the bond contract's specifics and assess their financial capability and risk tolerance before making a purchase. Details regarding the fees of each international school are available on their official websites, enabling parents to select a school that aligns with their financial planning.</p> <p>The annual school tuition fees at Wycombe Abbey in Hong Kong  for the 2023-2024 school year are:</p> <ul>     <li>- Grades 1 to 5: $188,000</li>     <li>- Grades 6 to 8: $198,000</li> </ul> <p>In addition, ordinary schools also set an annual school building fee (school fees are NT$35,000 per year) to fund the school's infrastructure, buildings and facilities, and maintenance. </p> <p>This information varies by school, so before making a final enrollment decision for your child, you should contact the school directly to obtain the most accurate and up-to-date information. </p> <p>Parents can also learn more about Wycombe Abbey International School Hong Kong&rsquo;s payment procedures, admission priority and nomination rights scheme here. </p> <p>Choosing an international school is a decision that requires careful consideration and planning. You need to understand the academic system, admissions procedures and tuition fees of different international schools and make the best choice based on your child's situation and needs. Please note that this information may vary from school to school, so you should contact the school directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information before making a final decision. </p> ","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/_Blog_Post_Digitas/International%20school%20academic%20system-admissions%20procedures-tuition%20fees/two-schoolgirls-working-together-assignment-classroom.jpg"">, <img src="""">"
【Primary One Admission】International school primary school vs. direct subsidy subsidy primary school - how to make the decision?,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3271/%E3%80%90Primary-One-Admission%E3%80%91International-School-vs.-Direct-Subsidy-Scheme---How-to-choose?---Wycombe-Abbey-School-Hong-Kong,"<p>Enrolling a child in primary one is a significant challenge for many parents, particularly in Hong Kong, where the competition in education is intense. Some parents aspire for their children to receive an international education, while others wish for their children to maintain their Chinese heritage. In this context, international schools and Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) schools have emerged as two popular options. But, what are the differences between these schools, and how should parents make a choice?</p> <p></p> <p>DSS primary schools in Hong Kong are government-subsidized institutions known for their high academic standards, rich curriculum, and superior teaching staff and campus facilities. These schools primarily use Chinese as the language of instruction and follow local curriculums or curriculums that incorporate international elements, such as the DSE, IGCSE, etc. This approach not only preserves Chinese traditions but also introduces students to global perspectives. The benefits of DSS schools include lower tuition fees and more relaxed admission criteria, allowing children to be immersed in a Chinese-speaking environment and cultivate their appreciation for Chinese culture and national identity. However, the limitations of DSS schools might include a lack of international exposure and competitiveness, potentially making them less suitable for children with a keen interest or talent in English or other foreign languages.</p> <p>International schools are characterized by their use of English or other foreign languages as the primary medium of instruction and by their adoption of globally recognized curriculums, such as the IB, AP, A-Level, etc. These schools aim to develop students' global perspectives and cross-cultural competencies. The advantages of international schools include exposing students to diverse cultures and thought processes, enhancing their language skills and creativity, and benefiting their future academic and career opportunities. On the downside, international schools typically have higher tuition fees, stricter admission standards, and a lesser focus on Chinese language education, which might impact the students' Chinese language proficiency and cultural identity.</p> <p>Consider the example of Wycombe Abbey School in Hong Kong, which is dedicated to enabling students to communicate fluently in English and adapt to Western cultures. The curriculum is grounded in the internationally recognized British National Curriculum used in England and Wales, while also ensuring that students receive a solid foundation in Chinese language and culture through specialized Chinese courses. Our educational approach combines academic rigor with a focus on students' physical and mental well-being.</p> <p>When it comes to the teaching model, international primary schools emphasize holistic education and encourage students to explore, think, and learn independently. They offer numerous opportunities for learning and international interaction, which greatly benefit students' development of a global vision and cross-cultural communication skills. With a diverse student body, these schools facilitate international exposure and cultural exchange. Typically, students in international primary schools continue their education within the same school's secondary section or pursue further education in other international schools or abroad. Conversely, DSS primary schools adhere to the local Education Bureau's curriculum requirements, focusing on academic knowledge and examination performance. These schools tend to have larger class sizes but offer more instruction in the native language and a local cultural context.</p> <p>Family values and educational objectives are crucial factors in school selection. International schools prioritize global citizenship and cross-cultural awareness, encouraging independent thought and problem-solving. If exposing your children to diverse cultures and developing an international outlook are your goals, international schools may be the preferable option. DSS primary schools, however, emphasize academic excellence and competitiveness, suiting families who value a strong foundation in the local education system or prefer local further education for their children.</p> <p>Regarding tuition fees, international schools typically charge higher rates than DSS schools. For example, the annual tuition fees for Wycombe Abbey School in Hong Kong for the 2023-2024 academic year are:</p> <p>Additionally, most schools also impose an annual fee for building and facilities maintenance (Wycombe Abbey charges $35,000 per year).</p> <p>Parents interested in learning more about payment procedures, admission priorities, and the nomination rights scheme at Wycombe Abbey School in Hong Kong are encouraged to seek further information.</p> <p>In conclusion, the choice between an international primary school and a DSS primary school involves multiple considerations, including cultural exposure, academic focus, and financial capacity, along with family values and educational goals. Ultimately, visiting and interviewing potential schools is essential to ensure they align with your expectations and meet a broad range of needs.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/_Blog_Post_Digitas/International%20School%20vs.%20Direct%20Subsidy%20Scheme%20-%20How%20to%20choose/schoolmates-blackboard-together.jpg"">"

As a parent, selecting the right school for your child involves understanding these differences. This article aims to compare local primary schools with international schools across several aspects, offering guidance for making an informed choice.</p> <p></p> <p>Initially, it's crucial to recognize the differing educational goals and philosophies of local and international schools. Local schools adhere to the Hong Kong Education Bureau's curriculum, emphasizing local content and examination systems. In contrast, international schools often follow global curriculums like the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) from the UK, focusing on holistic development and critical thinking to foster creativity and a global outlook in students.</p> <p>The local academic system comprises six years of primary education, followed by three years each of junior and senior secondary education, culminating in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE). This examination is pivotal for university admissions and marks the culmination of local education. Alternatives such as the IB Diploma, British National Curriculum, or American Common Core Curriculum present significant differences in educational approaches.</p> <p>An example of blending educational philosophies is the Wycombe Abbey School in Hong Kong, which integrates the British national curriculum with China's Chinese curriculum. This unique combination prepares students excellently for global secondary education and university entry.</p> <p>Parents interested in the Wycombe Abbey School of Hong Kong’s international private school curriculum can find more information here.</p> <p>While local schools primarily use Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese) for instruction, international schools predominantly teach in English. For children with a foundation in English, international schools might be more fitting, offering broader opportunities for international exchange and multicultural exposure compared to traditional local schools.</p> <p>Hong Kong's local schools maintain a rigorous teaching and evaluation system, with highly qualified and experienced teachers. International schools also boast quality teaching staff, focusing on developing students' critical thinking, creativity, and international awareness. Evaluating teaching quality can be done by examining school evaluations, academic achievements, and faculty qualifications.</p> <p>Generally, international schools command higher tuition fees than their local counterparts, with additional costs for registration, textbooks, and exams. Financial capacity and willingness to invest in education are critical considerations in this context.</p> <p>International schools often offer extra support services like language assistance, special educational needs support, and tutoring, which can be crucial for children requiring additional educational support.</p> <p>In conclusion, both local primary schools and international schools have their merits and drawbacks, without a clear-cut superior option. The decision should be based on:</p> <p>Other factors like the school's location, facilities, reputation, and the community's cultural atmosphere should also be considered. Remember, selecting a school is a deeply personal decision that should align with your family's needs and values.</p> <p>The Wycombe Abbey School of Hong Kong integrates the best of British and local Hong Kong education systems, ensuring students are well-prepared for future learning challenges. With English as the primary language of instruction, we aim to develop fluent English communicators who are culturally adept. Our curriculum, grounded in the British National Curriculum, is complemented by distinctive Chinese courses to ensure a robust foundation in both languages. Our educational approach balances academic rigor with physical and mental well-being, fostering an environment where critical thinking and immersive learning thrive. We believe in nurturing well-rounded, confident students ready to succeed in the future.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/_Blog_Post_Digitas/Hong%20Kong%20International%20School%20Selection%20Guide/7xm.xyz159600.jpg"">"
Choosing an International School: Differences from Local Schools,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3275/Why-choose-an-international-school?-How-is-it-different-from-local-schools?---Wycombe-Abbey-School-Hong-Kong,"<p>Deciding between an international school and a local school in Hong Kong is a pivotal choice many parents and students face, given the distinct educational philosophies, curricula, cultural backgrounds, and learning styles of each. This guide highlights key comparisons between international and local schools and outlines the advantages of international education.</p> <p></p> <p>Understanding the distinction between international and local schools is crucial. International schools typically follow foreign curriculums like the International Baccalaureate (IB) or British A-levels, whereas local schools adhere to the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) or similar local curriculums. Some institutions offer a blend of both educational paths.</p> <p>International schools are known for their adoption of globally recognized curriculums, such as the IB or Cambridge programs, focusing on developing critical thinking, creativity, cooperation, intercultural awareness, and global citizenship. Conversely, local schools, following the Hong Kong Education Bureau's curriculum, prioritize knowledge transfer, examination performance, and competitive advancement in further studies.</p> <p>International schools offer a more flexible and diverse curriculum, providing students the opportunity to explore their interests and develop expertise. The IB curriculum, for example, encompasses six main areas and three core components, promoting a well-rounded education. Local school curricula tend to be more rigid, focusing on core and elective subjects assessed primarily through public examinations.</p> <p>While international schools emphasize global citizenship qualities like critical thinking and cross-cultural awareness through varied teaching methods such as group discussions and project-based learning, local schools focus on traditional qualities like discipline and competitiveness, often employing lecture-based teaching and rote learning.</p> <p>International schools boast a diverse and inclusive environment with teachers and students from various countries, offering exposure to different languages, customs, and perspectives. Local schools, predominantly attended by Hong Kong natives, provide fewer opportunities for such international exposure.</p> <p>The tuition fees of international schools are generally higher than those of local schools, reflecting the greater expenses associated with higher teacher salaries, facility maintenance, and quality resources. International schools offer small class sizes, personalized guidance, and superior facilities, contributing to a comprehensive education. Tuition fees vary significantly between the two, with international schools providing more advanced resources like libraries, laboratories, and sports facilities.</p> <p>It's important to note that school culture, family values, educational goals, and the child's needs are crucial factors in selecting the right school. Parents are encouraged to engage with schools through open days and personal visits to ensure the chosen institution aligns with their expectations and their child's needs.</p> <p>Both international and local schools have their pros and cons, with the choice depending on the student's need for a comprehensive, global education against the backdrop of higher costs and the challenge of adapting to a diverse learning environment. Parents and students should weigh their options based on personal needs, interests, abilities, and future aspirations.</p> <p>For more information on Wycombe Abbey International Private School in Hong Kong, please visit our website.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/_Blog_Post_Digitas/Why%20choose%20an%20international%20school/7xm.xyz526053.jpg"">"

This article delves into the top five advantages of private schools in Hong Kong, shedding light on their unique benefits and features.</p> <p>Unlike public schools, private schools operate independently from the Education Bureau, granting them the freedom to tailor their curriculum, teaching methodologies, assessment techniques, and post-graduation plans. This flexibility allows private schools to align more closely with students' needs and interests, offering a more diverse and innovative educational experience. For instance, private schools might adopt international curriculums like the IB or IGCSE to foster global awareness and critical thinking, focus on non-academic subjects such as arts, music, and sports, or provide personalized attention through small class sizes and individual tutoring.</p> <p>Private schools are known for their high-quality teaching staff, excellent educational resources, and superior facilities. They maintain rigorous internal and external evaluation processes to ensure compliance with international educational standards. Graduates from private schools often enjoy higher rates of university admissions and employment, gaining entry into prestigious institutions and companies worldwide.</p> <p>The smaller student population in private schools fosters closer, more trusting relationships between teachers and students. This environment enables teachers to understand and cater to each student's unique needs, promoting a supportive and respectful learning atmosphere. Furthermore, private schools emphasize moral, values, and social responsibility, offering numerous opportunities for community service, volunteering, exchange programs, and other activities that reinforce students' citizenship and global outlook.</p> <p>Private primary schools are not bound by the secondary one allocation system, providing students with more freedom to choose their secondary education path based on personal interests and aspirations. This autonomy allows for a richer primary education experience, exposing students to a broader range of courses, activities, and experiences that prepare them for future academic and career endeavors.</p> <p>Private schools often feature active parent-teacher associations and other collaborative bodies, encouraging direct parental involvement in educational processes and decision-making. This collaboration fosters a strong community of families and educators, enhancing the educational experience and providing a supportive network for students and parents alike.</p> <p>Private schools in Hong Kong offer numerous advantages, providing a high-quality, varied, and comprehensive education. However, each school has its own distinct characteristics and ethos. When selecting a private school, parents should consider their family's expectations, needs, and practical considerations such as cost and location to make the most suitable choice.</p> <p>For more information on Wycombe Abbey International Private School in Hong Kong, please visit our website.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/_Blog_Post_Digitas/Analyze%20the%205%20major%20advantages%20of%20private%20schools/7xm.xyz746698.jpg"">"

Most of the teachers in British-style international schools come from the UK or other English-speaking countries. They are not only proficient in English teaching, but also familiar with various international education systems and courses. They will design appropriate teaching methods and strategies based on each student's level and needs, and provide timely feedback and guidance to help students improve their learning results and confidence.</p> <p>Here are some suggestions:</p> <p></p> <p>You can check the school's history, school philosophy, teachers, graduates' destination and other information to understand the school's educational level and characteristics. You can also refer to the school's performance in IGCSE and A Level exams to see student learning outcomes.</p> <p>You need to consider the range of tuition fees you can afford and the area where you would like your children to attend. British international schools in Hong Kong have different fees, and some may require additional admission fees or donations.

 Celebrating Rugby's Legacy at British Boarding Schools and the Hong Kong 7's,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3297/Celebrating-Rugby's-Legacy-at-British-Boarding-Schools-and-the-Hong-Kong-7's,"<p>Wycombe Abbey, a prestigiousinternational private school in Hong Kong,had the honour of hosting representatives from HK China Rugby, including their CEO, Mr Robbie McRobbie, and two of their distinguished players.</p> <p>The visit underscored the deep connection between the revered sport of rugby and the educational principles of British boarding schools, emphasising its importance in both Hong Kong and the UK, while also heightening our anticipation for the Hong Kong Sevens 2024!</p> <p>A fun fact about the origin of rugby is that it is commonly believed to have been invented in 1823 by William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School in England. According to legend, during a game of football (soccer), Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it, thereby creating a whole new game.</p> <p>While there's little historical evidence to support this exact moment as the birth of rugby, the story has become a popular part of rugby lore. The Rugby World Cup trophy is even named the Webb Ellis Cup in his honour!</p> <p>60 years later, Rugby Sevens originated in Melrose, Scotland, when the local club hosted a fundraising event and decided to play a shorter version of rugby with seven players on each side. The tournament was a success, leading to the adoption of sevens as a distinct variation of rugby with its own set of rules and gameplay.</p> <p>Ninety-three years later, in 1976, the inaugural Hong Kong Sevens took place.</p> <p>The tournament was launched to boost rugby's popularity in Asia.</p> <p>It was the brainchild of the Hong Kong Rugby Football Union's chairman, A.D.C. ""Tokkie"" Smith, who envisioned a tournament that would attract international teams and showcase the fast-paced excitement of rugby sevens to a broader audience.</p> <p>The inaugural event exceeded expectations, laying the foundation for what would become one of the most prestigious rugby sevens tournaments in the world.</p> <p>And, the rest, as they say, is history!</p> <p>British boarding schools have long integrated British sports culture into their educational programs, embracing sports not only as physical activities but as vital components of character and community building.</p> <p>This tradition reflects the belief that sports, particularly rugby, play a crucial role in developing well-rounded individuals who embody the values of teamwork, respect, and discipline.</p> <p>The visit from Mr Robbie McRobbie and the players provided our students at the private school with an extraordinary opportunity to immerse themselves in the nuances of professional rugby. Through interactive sessions, discussions, and firsthand stories from the athletes, students were able to grasp the profound impact that rugby can have on an individual's life.</p> <p>The visit also underscored rugby's role beyond the physical demands of the sport, highlighting its educational value in teaching life skills such as leadership, resilience, and strategic thinking.</p> <p>These lessons resonate with the principles of British boarding education, emphasizing the development of well-rounded individuals.</p> <p>The discussions naturally touched upon the Hong Kong Sevens, showcasing the global impact of rugby sevens.</p> <p></p> <p>Known for its vibrant atmosphere and high-level competition, the Hong Kong Sevens exemplifies the spirit of international rugby, bringing together teams and fans from across the globe.</p> <p>Our students at the private school were inspired by stories of the tournament's role in showcasing emerging talent, fostering global camaraderie, and serving as a practical extension of the classroom where values of respect, integrity, and excellence are displayed.</p> <p>The visit and the anticipation for the Hong Kong Sevens 2024 highlight rugby's educational value, especially in preparing students for life in British boarding schools.</p> <p>The sport provides a practical framework for students to apply their learning in real-world situations, preparing them not just for the academic challenges of boarding school but for the broader challenges of life.</p> <p>At Wycombe Abbey, we instill the essence of British sportsmanship and the strategic thinking, physical fitness, and team spirit central to rugby.</p> <p>The special visit from Hong Kong China Rugby, featuring Mr. Robbie McRobbie and two esteemed players, enriched our school community at Wycombe Abbey, bridging the worlds of British boarding education and international rugby.</p> <p>It reaffirmed the sport's place in ourcurriculumand culture, inspiring students with its blend of athletic rigour and character-building potential.</p> <p>As we look forward to the Hong Kong Sevens 2024, we are reminded of the enduring legacy of rugby and its capacity to unite people, cultures, and traditions in a shared celebration of excellence and sportsmanship, underscoring its vibrant role in preparing students at our school for the challenges of (possibly!) British boarding school and beyond.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/_Blog_Post_Digitas/RugbyPost/rugby.JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/pages/cont/News/_Blog_Post_Digitas/RugbyPost/rugby2.JPG"">"

This environment prepares children well for future studies in the UK.</p> <p></p> <p>Parents often rely on school rankings to choose the best school.

The school offers a variety of subjects, including humanities, sciences, mathematics, arts, and sports, to cater to students' diverse interests and strengths.</p> <p>Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong initially offers primary education from grades 1 to 6 and has since added middle school courses for grades 7 to 8. Graduates have achieved impressive academic results, with some gaining admission to prestigious UK boarding schools such as Roedean School and Badminton School, and others to traditional public schools like Rugby School and Cheltenham College. Some students continue their education at Wycombe Abbey School's main campus. Graduates staying in Hong Kong have also successfully enrolled in schools like Chinese International School, Canadian International School, and French International School, demonstrating the school's strong foundation for local, UK, and other international studies.</p> <p>In summary, when choosing an international school in Hong Kong, parents should consider their child's personality, interests, educational goals, and the school's teaching quality and curriculum content.

"Crossing Paths, Forging Connections: WASHK and WASCZ Exchange Adventures ","https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3303/Crossing-Paths,-Forging-Connections:-WASHK-and-WASCZ-Exchange-Adventures","<p>  At Wycombe Abbey School Hong Kong (WASHK) and Wycombe Abbey Changzhou (WASCZ), we believe in providing our students with enriching experiences that go beyond the traditional classroom setting. One such opportunity is the exchange trips between our two schools, where Year 4-8 students embark on Extracurricular Enrichment Trips. These visits not only celebrate the vibrant world of extra-curricular activities, with a focus on sports and music, but also foster connections, friendships, and personal growth among students. As we eagerly await future adventures together in the coming years, let us reflect on the memorable exchanges that have taken place between WASHK and WASCZ.</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>Experiencing State-of-the-Art Facilities</p><p></p><p>During the exchange trips, students from both schools have the privilege of experiencing the state-of-the-art facilities that each institution has to offer. From WASCZ's impressive multi-Sports Dome to the picturesque rowing boathouse, the students gain exposure to a diverse range of sporting activities in world-class facilities. The thrilling climbing wall and the music centre at WASHK further enhance their understanding and appreciation of sport, music and the arts.</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>Celebrating Extra-Curricular Pursuits</p><p></p><p>The exchange trips serve as a celebration of extra-curricular activities, where students showcase their talents and passions beyond the academic realm. Sports competitions, musical performances, and collaborative workshops provide a platform for students to shine and share their skills with peers from the other school. Through friendly competitions and joint activities, students develop team spirit, sportsmanship, and a sense of camaraderie, nurturing a supportive and inclusive environment.</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>Creating Connections and Friendships</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant outcomes of these exchange trips is the connections and friendships formed between students from WASHK and WASCZ. By interacting with peers from a different school environment, students gain a deeper appreciation for diversity, and enhance their language and social skills. These relationships extend beyond the duration of the trips, as students continue to stay connected, building a sense of unity between the two schools.</p><p></p><p>            </p><p></p><p>Boarding School Experience</p><p></p><p>As schools that prioritise holistic education, the exchange trips serve to nurture the emotional and social growth of students. The experience of being away from home, living in a boarding school environment, and adapting to a different routine offers valuable life lessons and prepares students for future boarding school experiences. By stepping outside their comfort zones, students get the chance to develop resilience, independence, and a sense of self-discovery, all while under the care and guidance of dedicated educators.</p><p></p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p></p><p>We are proud to witness the positive impact these trips have on our students' lives and are excited about the future opportunities that lie ahead.</p><p></p><p>In the spirit of collaboration and shared experiences, we look forward to strengthening the bond between WASHK and WASCZ, creating a unique and enriching educational journey for our students.</p><p>    </p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/HOU_0473.JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/HOU_0716.JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/HOU_1039.JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/HOU_1095.JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(129).png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(130).png"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(128).PNG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(131).PNG"">"

Debating Our Way to Success: A Recap of Our Winning Season,https://www.was.edu.hk/en/NewsDetail/3309/Debating-Our-Way-to-Success:-A-Recap-of-Our-Winning-Season,"<p>  We are thrilled to celebrate the exceptional achievements of our debate teams this academic year, as they have demonstrated remarkable skill and dedication in various debate competitions. Our teams have secured victories in many debate tournaments, with individual students also earning recognition as best speakers. The recent triumph of our Year 8 team in the Term 2 Round 2 debate of the Hong Kong Secondary Schools Debate Competition (HKSSDC), where they defended the side on the opposition for the motion ""This house would make current generations pay reparations for past injustices,"" further highlights their success.</p><p></p><p>Before this, our Year 7 students participated in the Talent Cup debate, emerging victorious in their round with one of our students named as the best speaker of the debate. In February, we proudly represented our school at the online International Parliamentary Debate Competition, in which two of our students advanced to the semi-finals. Additionally, three of our students received individual speaker awards for this competition.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>Earlier in the academic year, some our students participated in the prestigious Oxford Schools Debating Competition, engaging in three impromptu debates against leading Hong Kong schools. This British Parliamentary debate format provided invaluable insights into the debate style of the UK House of Commons and House of Lords, allowing our students to assume roles such as Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>Throughout the year, we have actively participated in various other debate competitions, providing our students with numerous opportunities to showcase their skills and learn from each experience. We are immensely proud of the growth in confidence exhibited by our debate teams over the past three terms.</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>Head of Speech and Drama and the Debate Society, Nicola Rae, says, ""It has been wonderful to see the debate teams grow in confidence over the past 3 terms, and I am very proud of the debates they have won. Even the debates we have conceded have been a great learning experience because the students have always been able to reflect on how they did and identify areas they could improve on for their next debate. The teamwork and sense of collaboration among the groups, both primary and secondary, have been outstanding and the collective support for each other has been so encouraging to witness. Some of the motions have been extremely challenging, but the students have never wavered in their determination to research and consider arguments for both sides of a motion. This, in turn, has helped develop their critical thinking skills.""</p><p></p><p>       </p><p></p><p>We extend our heartfelt congratulations to all our debaters for their outstanding achievements this year. Their success serves as an inspiration to their peers and a testament to the values of critical thinking, collaboration, and resilience that we hold dear at our school. We eagerly anticipate the forthcoming debates and are confident that our debate teams will continue to excel, leaving a lasting impact on the world of competitive debating.</p>","<img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(179).JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(180).JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(181).JPG"">, <img src=""https://www.was.edu.hk/NewImages/3/News/April/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(182).JPG"">"
